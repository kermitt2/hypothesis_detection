CL	D14-1078	mn	5	4	proposal	motivation_hypothesis	none	support	main	secondary	back	support	To this effect , the talk explores how integrating microeconomic models of human behavior into the learning process leads to new interaction models and their associated learning algorithms , leading to systems that have provable guarantees and that perform robustly in practice .	In this talk , I argue that the design space of such interactive learning systems encompasses not only the machine learning algorithm itself , but also the design of the interaction under an appropriate model of user behavior .
