Restoration of vancomycin susceptibility in Enterococcus faecalis by antiresistance determinant gene transfer. We assessed the ability of gene transfer to reverse vancomycin resistance in class A (VanA) glycopeptide-resistant Enterococcus faecalis. Recombinant shuttle vectors containing a vanH promoter-vanA antisense gene cassette fully restored vancomycin susceptibility through a combined transcriptional activator binding domain decoy and inducible vanA antisense RNA effect.
