Characterization of the cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in the in vitro metabolism of rosiglitazone.


AIMS: To identify the  human cytochrome P450 enzyme (s) involved in the in vitro metabolism of rosiglitazone, a potential oral antidiabetic agent for the treatment of type 2 diabetes-mellitus.
Method The specific P450 enzymes involved in the metabolism of rosiglitazone were determined by a combination of three approaches; multiple regression analysis of the rates of metabolism of rosiglitazone in human liver microsomes against selective P450 substrates, the effect of selective chemical  inhibitors on rosiglitazone metabolism and the capability of expressed P450 enzymesto mediate the major metabolic routes of rosiglitazone metabolism.
Result The major products of metabolism following incubation of rosiglitazone with human liver microsomes were para-hydroxy and N-desmethyl rosiglitazone.
    The rate of formation varied over 38-fold in the 47 human livers investigated and correlated with paclitaxel 6alpha-hydroxylation (P<0.001).

    Formation of these metabolites was inhibited significantly (>50%) by 13-cis retinoic acid, a CYP2C8 inhibitor, but not by furafylline, quinidine or ketoconazole.

    In addition, both metabolites were produced by microsomes derived from a cell line transfected with human CYP2C8 cDNA.
There was some evidence for CYP2C9 playing a minor role in the metabolism of rosiglitazone .

    Sulphaphenazole caused limited inhibition (<30%) of both pathways in human liver microsomes and microsomes from cells transfected with CYP2C9 cDNA were able to mediate the metabolism of rosiglitazone, in particular the N-demethylation pathway, albeit at a much slower rate than CYP2C8.


    Rosiglitazone caused moderate inhibition of paclitaxel 6alpha-hydroxylase activity (CYP2C8; IC50=18 microM ), weak inhibition of tolbutamide hydroxylase activity (CYP2C9; IC50=50 microM ) but caused no marked inhibition of the other cytochrome P450 activities investigated (CYP1A2,2A6,2C9,2C19, 2D6,2E1,3A and 4A) .

Conclusion CYP2C8 is primarily responsible for the hydroxylation and N-demethylation of rosiglitazone in human liver; with minor contributions from  CYP2C9.
