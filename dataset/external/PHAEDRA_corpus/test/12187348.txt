Gigantomastia induced by bucillamine.

Drug-induced mammary hyperplasias have been reported as rare complications of D-penicillamine and Neothetazone. The authors report the first case of bucillamine-induced giant mammary hyperplasia. Bucillamine is used as an antirheumatic drug that is structurally analogous to D-penicillamine. A 25-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis for the past 5 years started to develop gradual enlargement of her breasts 15 months before presentation. She had been on a combined treatment of steroid and lobenzarit disodium for the first 3 years, and then continued with a combined treatment of steroid and bucillamine for the following years until she was found to have pulmonary tuberculosis, at which time the steroid was suspended 10 months before she visited the authors' clinic. An almost total breast reduction was performed; 5 kg of right breast tissue and 7 kg of left breast tissue were excised. Retrospectively, bucillamine was believed to be the cause of the giant hypertrophy because of its structural similarity to D-penicillamine, which was the subject of an abundance of reports of mammary hyperplasia.
