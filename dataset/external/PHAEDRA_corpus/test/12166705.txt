Mitomycin-C induced hemolytic uremic syndrome: a case report.

Mitomycin-C is used widely in the treatment of malignancies and is associated with serious dose related adverse effects including the occurrence of hemolytic uremic syndrome. We report a patient with a colonic adenocarcinoma who developed hemolytic uremic syndrome after receiving 85 mg/m2 of the drug. The patient was left untreated and died 5 months after this diagnosis was made, of a second malignancy. Differential diagnosis and treatment of this condition are discussed.
