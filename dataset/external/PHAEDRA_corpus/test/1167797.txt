Interaction between oxytocin and antidiuretic hormone and its effect on the milk secretion by alveoli of the mammary gland of lactating rats. Interaction between exogenous and endogenous oxytocin and vasopressin was found to affect the mechanism of milk ejection by the alveoli of the mammary gland in lactating rats. Inhibition and stimulation of the effect of oxytocin on milk ejection by vasopressin was demonstrated. On the basis of the principles observed the concentrations fo these hormones were investigated in the plasma of dogs deprived of water for 3 days and then allowed to drink.
