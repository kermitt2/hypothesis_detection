 The effect of erythromycin, fluvoxamine, and their combination on the pharmacokinetics of ropivacaine.


 We studied the effect of fluvoxamine and erythromycin on the pharmacokinetics of ropivacaine in a double-blinded, randomized, four-way cross-over study.
 Eight healthy volunteers ingested daily 1500 mg erythromycin for 6 days, 100 mg fluvoxamine for 5 days (Days 2-6), both erythromycin and fluvoxamine, or placebo.
 On Day 6, each subject received a single dose of 0.6 mg/kg ropivacaine IV over 30 min.
 Ropivacaine, 3-hydroxyropivacaine, and 2',6'-pipecoloxylidide in venous plasma and urine samples were measured for up to 12 h and 24 h, respectively.

     Fluvoxamine increased the area under the drug plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of ropivacaine 3.7-fold (P: < 0.001), prolonged the elimination half-life (t(1/2)) from 2.3 to 7.4 h (P: < 0.01), and decreased the clearance by 77% (P: < 0.001).


     Erythromycin alone had only a minor effect on the pharmacokinetics of ropivacaine.


     However, when compared with fluvoxamine alone, the combination of fluvoxamine and erythromycin further increased the area under the drug plasma concentration-time curve and t(1/2) of ropivacaine by 50% (P: < 0.01).


     We conclude that inhibition of CYP1A2 by fluvoxamine considerably reduces elimination of ropivacaine.


     Concomitant use of fluvoxamine and CYP3A4 inhibitor erythromycin further increases plasma ropivacaine concentration by decreasing its clearance.

 Implications: Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of increased toxicity of ropivacaine when used together with inhibitors of CYP1A2.
 Concomitant use of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 inhibitors further increases ropivacaine concentration.
