Pulmonary edema during acute infusion of epoprostenol in a patient with pulmonary hypertension and limited scleroderma.

Epoprostenol (prostacyclin) is currently approved for treatment of primary pulmonary hypertension; however, it is being evaluated in other forms of pulmonary hypertension, particularly scleroderma. Side effects associated with this medication are usually minor; serious complications are most often due to the delivery system required for continuous infusion. We describe a life threatening side effect of acute epoprostenol infusion (pulmonary edema) in a patient with pulmonary hypertension associated with limited scleroderma and discuss its management and potential etiology. This is the first case where epoprostenol has been successfully reinstituted.
