Anaesthesia and the epileptic pateint. A review. A review is presented of some of the problems that may arise in association with anaesthesia for epileptic patients. There is the possibility of precipitating anticonvulsant drug toxicity. Numerous drug interactions are possible with some anticonvulsant agents, such as phenobarbitone and phenytoin, which affect hepatic microsomal enzyme systems. There is the risk of convulsions occurring in susceptible patients following the use of the new anaesthetic agents which are capable of inducing CNS excitability.
