Carbamazepine induced right bundle branch block in a Greenlandic patient.

A 53 year old Greenlandic male was admitted twice over a period of 4 years with a new complete right bundle branch block after ingestion of 10 g and 4 g of carbamazepine respectively. In both instances, reversion of intraventricular conduction to normal occurred within 72 hours, coinciding with clearance of carbamazepine from the blood stream. We recommend routine follow up by ECG of patients over the age of 50 treated with carbamazepine.
