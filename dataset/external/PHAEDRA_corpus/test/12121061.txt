Ticlopidine-induced marrow aplasia treated with cyclosporine.

A 50-year-old diabetic and hypertensive male patient is reported who had ticlopidine-induced marrow aplasia partially responsive to colony-stimulating factors and corticosteroids, but experienced complete recovery with cyclosporine. There is no consensus on the treatment of ticlopidine-induced marrow aplasia. Although many cases are reported to recover with colony-stimulating factors and corticosteroids, others are unresponsive or partially responsive. Our patient also did not completely respond to these medications, but was successfully treated with cyclosporine alone. Alone or in combination with corticosteroids, cyclosporine is an effective drug of choice for the resistant patients.
