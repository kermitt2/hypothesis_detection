Clinical implications of warfarin interactions with five sedatives. The intensity, uniformity and time course of anticoagulant interference by phenobarbital, secobarbital, glutethimide, chloral hydrate and methaqualone were systematically investigated in 16 patients receiving coumarin therapy. Each subject received an individualized fixed daily dose of warfarin and served as his own pre- and postsedative treatment control. Prothrombin times were measured four times weekly during five long-term experiments. Anticoagulant inhibition was observed during the administration of phenobarbital, secobarbital and glutethimide; there was no significant change in prothrombin test results during the trials of chloral hydrate and methaqualone. Barbiturates and glutethimide should not be administered to patients receiving coumarin drugs. The concurrent use of drugs from these groups is decreasing according to a survey of 200 hospital medical records. Chloral hydrate and methaqualone interact pharmacologically with orally administered anticoagulant agents, but the effect is not clinically significant. It is concluded that chloral hydrate and methaqualone may be administered safely without additional caution in prothrombin test monitoring during oral anticoagulant therapy.
