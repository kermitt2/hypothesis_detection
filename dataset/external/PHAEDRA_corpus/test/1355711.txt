     Inhibition of debrisoquin clearance in perfused rat livers and inhibition of dextromethorphan metabolism in human liver microsomes by 4-hydroxydebrisoquin or other metabolites of debrisoquin.


 Debrisoquin undergoes oxidative metabolism to 4-hydroxydebrisoquin, catalyzed by cytochrome CYP2D1 in rats and CYP2D6 in humans.
 Cytochrome CYP2D6 also plays a major role in dextromethorphan O-demethylation.
 In preliminary studies in perfused Lewis rat livers, we observed a difference in repeat clearance experiments using debrisoquin, but not dextromethorphan.
 To determine whether this change in clearance with time was due to the accumulation of 4-hydroxydebrisoquin, we sequentially used a recirculating and nonrecirculating perfusion system in the same liver perfusion experiment.
 We also studied the kinetics of dextromethorphan O-demethylation in microsomes prepared from human and rat livers in the presence and absence of 4-hydroxydebrisoquin.
     Results from the perfused rat liver experiments showed a drop in clearance from 3.27 +/- 0.57 ml/min (clearance 1) to 1.61 +/- 0.27 ml/min (clearance 2) (p less than 0.05 vs. clearance 1) during recirculation, but clearance returned to 3.21 +/- 0.46 ml/min (clearance 3, no significance vs. clearance 1) after a 30-min period of liver perfusion using a nonrecirculating system.
 There was significant accumulation of 4-hydroxydebrisoquin in the liver perfusate during recirculation, and concentrations fell when the nonrecirculating system was used.

     In microsomal studies, 4-hydroxydebrisoquin competitively inhibited dextromethorphan metabolism in human microsomes was 600 microM.


     These data suggest that: (a) 4-hydroxydebrisoquin and/or other metabolites of debrisoquin have an inhibitory effect on CYP2D1 and CYP2D6; (b) the active site of human CYP2D6 has different substrate specificity than the rat isozyme (CYP2D1) and/or that the pathways of metabolism of dextromethorphan are different in the Lewis rat and not primarily dependent on the activity of CYP2D1.
