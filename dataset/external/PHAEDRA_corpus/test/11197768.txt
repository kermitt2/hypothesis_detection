Toxicity of cadmium and zinc to miracidia of Schistosoma mansoni. The specific objectives of this study were to elucidate metal toxicity to hatching, survival and avoidance behaviour of Schistosoma mansoni miracidia. The toxicity of cadmium, zinc, and cadmium/zinc mixtures at concentrations ranging from 10000 to 10 microg/l was investigated. Metal mixture toxicity investigation was undertaken with equal concentrations of the metals. The hatching of miracidia from eggs was inhibited by concentrations of 1000-10000 microg/l of single metals. Metal mixtures had no effect on egg hatching. Survival of miracidia was reduced by increasing metal concentration except at concentrations of 10 microg/l for single metal toxicity where survival was increased above the control. Miracidia demonstrated a rapid avoidance behaviour when briefly exposed to heavy metals. The mechanisms of metal toxicity to miracidia are briefly discussed.
