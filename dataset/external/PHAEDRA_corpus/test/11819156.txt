Neuroleptic malignant syndrome in a patient with succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency.

A patient suffering from a rare enzyme deficiency developed a malignant neuroleptic syndrome after having been treated with one single dose of haloperidol. We investigated the patient's serum for all frequent polymorphisms in cytochrome P450 2D6, assuming him to be a poor neuroleptic metabolizer. We will also discuss other potential mechanisms inducing this disturbance and its differential diagnoses.
