Hair loss associated with paroxetine treatment: a case report.

Alopecia and hair loss are rare side effects of psychotropic drugs. There are a few case reports on hair loss associated with tricyclic antidepressants and serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), but none deal specifically with paroxetine. We report on a 37-year-old female who complained of moderate hair loss during paroxetine treatment. Findings on discontinuation and rechallenge supported the assumption that the hair loss was a side effect of the paroxetine. Further investigation is needed to determine the scope of this troubling side effect.
