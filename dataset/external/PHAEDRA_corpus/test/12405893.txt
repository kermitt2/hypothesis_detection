Remission of lymphoma after drug withdrawal in rheumatoid arthritis.

A 63-year-old man with rheumatoid arthritis presented with pain and swelling of his right buttock. Imaging and tissue biopsy revealed a diffuse large B-cell, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The disease-modifying drugs he was taking, cyclosporin and methotrexate, were stopped, and the lymphoma resolved spontaneously without the use of chemotherapy.
