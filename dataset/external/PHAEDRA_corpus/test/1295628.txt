Carbamazepine-induced systemic lupus erythematosus-like disease.

A 14-year-old female developed systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)-like symptoms, rash, fever, leukopenia and positive anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) two weeks after administration of carbamazepine (CBZ; Tegretol) used against benign Rolandic epilepsy. Clinical symptoms and leukopenia normalized after discontinuation of CBZ and administration of prednisolone at 40 mg. The cases of CBZ-induced SLE reported in the literature were reviewed.
