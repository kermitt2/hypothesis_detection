Biotransformation of alprazolam by members of the human cytochrome P4503A subfamily.


1.
To aid in the prediction of drug interactions with alprazolam, the human CYP involved in the 1'- and 4-hydroxylation of alprazolam were characterized using human liver microsomes, expressed enzymes and selective chemical inhibitors.
2.

    The formation of 4-hydroxyalprazolam and 1'-hydroxyalprazolam at an alprazolam concentration of 62.5 microM were reduced by the prototypic CYP3A inhibitor,troleandomycin (50 microM), by 97 and 9900 respectively.

Only microsomes from B-lymphoblastoid cells expressing CYP3A4 were capable of catalysing the 1'- and 4-hydroxylation of alprazolam.
3.
    The formation rates of 1'-hydroxyalprazolam and 4-hydroxyalprazolam at an alprazolam concentration of 1 mM were significantly correlated (n = 19, r = 0.95, p<0.01) indicating that the same enzyme(s) mediated these biotransformations.
A significant (p<0.01) correlation was observed between alprazolam 4- and 1'-hydroxylase activity and CYP3A-mediatedmidazolam 4-hydroxylase, midazolam 1'-hydroxylase,dextromethorphan N-demethylase and erythromycin N-demethylase activities.
4.
In conclusion, in adult human liver the CYP3A subfamily members are the principal enzymes involved in the 1'- and 4-hydroxylation of alprazolam.
Thus, clinically significant drug drug interactions between alprazolam and other CYP3A substrates are to be expected.
