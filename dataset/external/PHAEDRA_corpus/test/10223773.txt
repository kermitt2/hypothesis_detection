 The effect of rifampin on the pharmacokinetics of oral and intravenous ondansetron.


 Ondansetron is an antiemetic agent metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes.
 Rifampin (INN, rifampicin) is a potent inducer of CYP3A4 and some other CYP enzymes.
 We examined the possible effect of rifampin on the pharmacokinetics of orally and intravenously administered ondansetron.
 In a randomized crossover study with 4 phases and a washout of 4 weeks, 10 healthy volunteers took either 600 mg rifampin (in 2 phases) or placebo (in 2 phases) once a day for 5 days.
 On day 6, 8 mg ondansetron was administered either orally (after rifampin and placebo) or intravenously (after rifampin and placebo).
 Ondansetron concentrations in plasma were measured up to 12 hours.

     The mean total area under the plasma concentration-time curve  [AUC(0-infinity)] of orally administered ondansetron after rifampin pretreatment was reduced by 65% compared with placebo (P < .001).


     Rifampin decreased the peak plasma concentration of oral ondansetron by about 50% (from 27.2+/-3.0 to 13.8+/-1.5 ng/mL  [mean +/- SEM]; P < .001]) and the elimination half-life (t1/2) by 38% (P < .01).


     The bioavailability of oral ondansetron was reduced from 60% to 40% (P < .01) by rifampin.


     The clearance of intravenous ondansetron was increased 83% (from 440+/-38.4 to 805+/-44.6 mL/min  [P < .001]) by rifampin.


     Rifampin reduced the t1/2 of intravenously administered ondansetron by 46% (P < .001) and the AUC(0-infinity) by 48% (P < .001).


     Rifampin considerably decreases the plasma concentrations of ondansetron after both oral and intravenous administration.

 The interaction is most likely the result of induction of the CYP3A4-mediated metabolism of ondansetron.

     Concomitant use of rifampin or other potent inducers of CYP3A4 with ondansetron may result in a reduced antiemetic effect, particularly after oral administration of ondansetron.
