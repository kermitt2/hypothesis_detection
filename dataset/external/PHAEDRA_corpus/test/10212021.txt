Methadone withdrawal when starting an antiretroviral regimen including nevirapine.
Antiretrovirals from three drug classes, nucleoside analogs, nonnucleoside analogs, and protease inhibitors, can be combined to achieve viral suppression. The nonnucleoside analog nevirapine is an inducer of cytochrome P450 3A4 liver metabolism and has interactions with protease inhibitors and oral contraceptives. Methadone has two roles in human immunodeficiency viral infection: pain management and treatment of opioid abuse. A drug-drug interaction may result in decreased methadone blood levels when administered with nevirapine. A patient experienced methadone withdrawal symptoms when combining these agents.
