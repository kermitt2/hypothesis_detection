Possible clinically significant interaction of itraconazole plus rifampin.
We report two patients treated with the combination of itraconazole plus rifampin for more than 4 months. While on itraconazole plus rifampin, patient 1 lost weight at a rate of 30 g/d. After stopping rifampin, he gained 14 g/d. While on itraconazole plus rifampin, patient 2 lost 41 grams/day. After stopping rifampin, he gained 33 g/d. Weight loss while taking the combination of itraconazole plus rifampin, followed by weight gain after stopping rifampin, suggests the possibility of a clinically significant drug interaction between itraconazole and rifampin.
