Methadone-induced myoclonus in advanced cancer.

Methadone is recommended as being free of some of the neuropsychological side effects noticed with morphine, which are attributed to active metabolites. A patient that received methadone for cancer-associated pain developed myoclonus as a side effect. This has rarely been reported before in the literature. The pathophysiology and management of myoclonus are discussed.
