Novel insights into the synergistic interaction of Bortezomib and TRAIL: tBid provides the link. The proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib has been identified as a potent enhancer of TRAIL-induced apoptosis in several human cancers. However, the identification of the underlying molecular mechanisms of this synergistic cell death induction has been ongoing over the last years. A recent study identifies a new mechanism of action for the synergism of TRAIL and Bortezomib.
