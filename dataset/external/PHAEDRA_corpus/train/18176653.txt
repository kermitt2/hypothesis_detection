Oral adverse effects due to the use of Nevirapine.

AIM: The aim of this article is to present the clinical characteristics and management of an oral adverse effect stemming from the use of the antiretroviral medication Nevirapine (NVP).
BACKGROUND: NVP is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor used in the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection.
CASE REPORT: A 29-year-old black man, HIV-infected since 1996, began highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) with zidovudine, lamivudine, and indinavir. From 1996 to 2002 several medications were changed due to their adverse effects: indinavir (renal colic and fever), nelfinavir (cutaneous rash), and efavirenz (nausea and temporary memory loss). When the patient presented to our service he was taking NVP, zidovudine, and lamivudine. A whitish plaque in the lips and bilateral buccal mucosa, burning, taste disturbance, and xerostomia were observed. The discontinuation of HAART led to the complete resolution of signs and symptoms. The patient has received follow-up treatment for three years and five months without local or systemic effects observed.
SUMMARY: Unfortunately, the clinical features of the oral adverse effect from NVP are not well known. This paper contributed to the identification of possible reactions in the oral cavity due to antiretroviral medication. Although HAART is very important in the treatment of HIV, its side effects are responsible for patients' non-adherence to medications. While more studies are needed to better understand the mechanism of action after suspending HAART, the complete resolution of the signs and symptoms was observed. Therefore, physicians and dentists alike must understand how to identify and prevent these adverse effects in order to further improve HIV patient treatments.
