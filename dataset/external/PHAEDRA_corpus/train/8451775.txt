     Citalopram: interaction studies with levomepromazine, imipramine, and lithium.


 The pharmacokinetic interactions between the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor citalopram, given as an oral dose of 40 mg/day for 10 days, and (1) levomepromazine (50 mg single oral dose), (2) imipramine (100 mg single oral dose), and (3) lithium (30 mmol/day orally for 5 days) were examined in three panels each of 8 healthy young male volunteers (age 20-31).
 All volunteers were classified as extensive metabolizers of sparteine and mephenytoin.
 Each subject completed three study phases--one with citalopram alone, one with one of the three other drugs, alone, and one with citalopram combined with the corresponding other drug.
 For citalopram and its metabolites, a non-enantioselective analytical method (high-performance liquid chromatography) was used.
 Only two statistically significant interactions were indicated.

     First, levomepromazine caused a 10-20% increase from the initial steady-state levels of the primary citalopram metabolite, desmethylcitalopram.


     Second, citalopram caused approximately 50% increase in the single-dose area under the serum concentration/time curve of desipramine (primary metabolite or imipramine) and a corresponding reduction in the level of the subsequently formed metabolite 2-hydroxydesipramine.

 These findings are in agreement with the recent observations that (1) the demethylation of desmethylcitalopram (to didesmethylcytalopram) is partly mediated via the sparteine/debrisoquine oxygenase (CYP2D6) and that levomepromazine is a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6, and (2) that desmethylcitalopram has a somewhat stronger affinity for CYP2D6 than desipramine, and therefore may inhibit the hydroxylation of desipramine, which is also a substrate of CYP2D6.
