Sequential CT studies of 24 children with infantile spasms on ACTH therapy.

Sequential CT studies were performed in 24 patients with infantile spasms, before, during and after ACTH therapy, in order to analyze the relationship between the dose of ACTH and changes in CT scan findings. In six cases CT scans did not return to their original state after ACTH therapy. Two illustrative cases are reported. There was a good correlation between the total dose of ACTH and the percentage decrease of brain parenchyma. It is concluded that 'cerebral atrophy' on CT scans may represent an accumulative effect of ACTH and that ACTH should be given with the utmost discretion, and in as low a dose as possible.
