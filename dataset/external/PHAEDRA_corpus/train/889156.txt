The use of beclomethasone diproprionate inhaler complicated by the development of an eosinophilic pneumonia reaction.

As an insoluble steroid aerosol, beclomethasone diproprionate was recently made available in the United States. Only minor complications have been reported previously. A more serious development of adrenal insufficiency may occur upon the improper replacement of systemic steroids. We report on a patient who developed the clinical findings of pulmonary eosinophilia. The possible mechanisms for this complication in out patient are discussed. While a lower systemic steroid dosage may have been the provoking factor, we feel that an adverse reaction to oleic acid, a dispersing agent in the aerosol freon vehicle, is a strong possibility.
