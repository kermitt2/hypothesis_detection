Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura during penicillamine therapy in rheumatoid arthritis.

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) developed in a patient with seropositive rheumatoid arthritis (RA) after 2 1/2 months of treatment with penicillamine. After discontinuation of the drug, plasmapheresis and steroid therapy led to a sustained remission. To our knowledge, no prior cases of penicillamine-induced TTP in RA have been reported.
