Polypharmacy and perioperative medications in the elderly.
Polypharmacy is a significant and complex problem affecting more than 40% of the geriatric population. Accurate medication histories may be difficult to obtain, but must include over-the-counter remedies as well as prescription. Physiologic changes occur with aging that predispose elderly patients to adverse drug events. At a minimum, medications with significant anticholinergic properties should be recognized and avoided in the perioperative period.
