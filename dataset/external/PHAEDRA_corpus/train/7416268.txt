Disulfiram encephalopathy as a cause of the catatonia syndrome.

The authors describe a case of the catatonia syndrome associated with disulfiram therapy. Although useful in the management of chronic alcoholism, disulfiram is being increasingly associated with a wide spectrum of side effects and untoward medical sequelae, which now include catatonia. The authors note that catatonia is a clinical syndrome associated with multiple medical conditions as well as psychiatric disorders.
