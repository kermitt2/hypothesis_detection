Escitalopram is a weak inhibitor of the CYP2D6-catalyzed O-demethylation of (+)-tramadol but does not reduce the hypoalgesic effect in experimental pain.
Tramadol is O-demethylated to the active metabolite (+)-O-desmethyltramadol ((+)-M1) via CYP2D6, an enzyme that is weakly inhibited by escitalopram. We investigated the possibility of a pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) effect of escitalopram on tramadol metabolism. Fifteen healthy subjects completed this randomized, double-blind, three-phase, crossover trial. Combinations of escitalopram 20 mg/day or placebo together with tramadol 150 mg or placebo were used. Blood samples for pharmacokinetics were drawn at 0-24 h after medication. The analgesic effect of (+)-M was assessed by the cold pressor test (CPT) (area under effect curve, 1-12 h after medication (AUEC(1-12))). The median area under plasma concentration-time curve extrapolated to infinity (AUC(0-infinity)) of (+)-M1 was 2.75 micromol/l.h after placebo pretreatment compared with 1.95 micromol/l.h after escitalopram (P = 0.0027). The mean AUEC(1-12) of CPT were 4,140 and 4,388 cm.s after placebo and escitalopram, respectively (P = 0.71). Although escitalopram is a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6, it does not impair the analgesic effect of tramadol.
