Severe anaemia related to oseltamivir during treatment of chronic hepatitis C: a new drug interaction?
Treatment for hepatitis C virus is often complicated by anaemia from ribavirin-related haemolysis and bone marrow suppression because of peginterferon alfa. An extensive literature search revealed no reports of drug interactions between ribavirin and oseltamivir. We report the case of a patient with chronic hepatitis C infection who developed severe anaemia during antiviral treatment with peginterferon alfa/ribavirin when oseltamivir was added to treat influenza. The adverse events related to ribavirin and drug-drug interactions during therapy for hepatitis C are discussed.
