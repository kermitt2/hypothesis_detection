First trimester disulfiram exposure: report of two cases.

Disulfiram has been used effectively to deter alcohol consumption in patients with a history of alcohol abuse. Its use in reproductive age women has become increasingly common in recent years, intensifying the risk of fetal exposure. Nonspecific but significant abnormalities have been described in the infants of women treated with disulfiram in the first trimester of their pregnancies. Based on these data, authors have previously exposure is confirmed despite a lack of any pattern to the defects reported. We report the outcomes of two pregnancies with first trimester disulfiram exposure. In both cases, the timing and dose of disulfiram was known. In one case, disulfiram was the only potential teratogen exposed to the fetus. Both neonates were normal at birth and have shown subsequent normal development. This report suggests that the poor prognosis previously given to fetuses exposed to disulfiram in the first trimester may not be warranted.
