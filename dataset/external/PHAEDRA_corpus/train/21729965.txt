Implanon   failure in an HIV-positive woman on antiretroviral therapy resulting in two ectopic pregnancies. Since its introduction in 1999, Implanon   remains one of the preferred contraceptive choices for many women as it offers a highly effective means of long-term contraception for three years that does not rely on adherence. Like all hormonal contraceptives, certain hepatic enzyme-inducing drugs may reduce its efficacy. We present an interesting case of an HIV-positive woman on antiretroviral therapy having tubal pregnancies on two separate occasions with Implanon in place.
