A significant interaction between moxifloxacin and warfarin in a patient with a mitral bioprosthetic valve.
Moxifloxacin is an advanced-generation fluoroquinolone with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity that is not metabolized by cytochrome P450 system. Therefore, the drug interaction of moxifloxacin is rarely seen. It has been reported that moxifloxacin is safe and well tolerable. We aimed to report a drug interaction between moxifloxacin and warfarin in a 74-year-old patient with a prosthetic mitral valve.
