Rhabdomyolysis due to an uncommon interaction of ciprofloxacin with simvastatin.
A case report of a ciprofloxacin and simvastatin interaction is presented. The addition of ciprofloxacin to chronic simvastatin therapy led to the development of rhabdomyolysis. As ciprofloxacin is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4, it is very likely that other mechanisms involving the ATP-binding cassette drug efflux transporter family played a role in this drug interaction.
