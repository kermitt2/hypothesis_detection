Modified oral anticoagulant potency in an amitriptyline-treated patient?
We report the case of a 74-year-old female patient who received the antide-pressant amitriptyline because of a major depression. Incidence of acute lower extremity venous thrombosis required an additional oral anticoagulant therapy with phenprocoumon. During the simultaneous adjustment of both substances, the Quick value displayed great fluctuations which only disappeared after discontinuation of the amitriptyline medication. This finding is discussed as an aspect of a possible drug-drug interaction between amitriptyline and phenprocoumon.
