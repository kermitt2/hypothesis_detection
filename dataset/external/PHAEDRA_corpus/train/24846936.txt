Fatal methylene blue associated serotonin toxicity.
This is the first report of a fatal outcome from serotonin toxicity, precipitated by an interaction between methylene blue and venlafaxine. Methylene blue-associated serotonin toxicity has been described before but usually as mild toxicity. Its presentation after general anaesthesia may be atypical and therefore more difficult to diagnose. However, the syndrome is completely preventable if serotonin re-uptake inhibiting agents are stopped beforehand.
