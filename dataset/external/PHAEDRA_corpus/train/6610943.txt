Myoglobinuria and acute renal failure associated with intravenous vasopressin infusion.

Myoglobinuria and acute renal failure were observed in two patients with vasopressin-treated gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Because there were no other obvious causes of renal failure in either patient, we propose that skeletal muscle ischemia developed during vasopressin infusion, followed by release of myoglobin and renal damage. This association should be considered in the period after vasopressin-treated gastrointestinal hemorrhage.
