 Oxidation of histamine H1 antagonist mequitazine is catalyzed by cytochrome P450 2D6 in human liver microsomes.


 Mequitazine  [10-(3-quinuclidinylmethyl) phenothiazine] is a long-acting and selective histamine H1-receptor antagonist that is mainly biotransformed by human liver microsomes to yield hydroxylated and S-oxidized metabolites.

     Mequitazine hydroxylase was inhibited by propranolol and quinidine.

 Lineweaver-Burk plots for the hydroxylation and the S-oxidation indicated that the hydroxylation occurred with a low Km (0.72 +/- .26 microM) in human liver microsomes.
 Microsomes from genetically engineered human B-lymphoblastoid cells expressing cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) efficiently metabolized mequitazine to the hydroxylated and S-oxidized metabolites.
 The results indicate that CYP2D6 isozyme is a major form of CYP responsible for the metabolism of mequitazine in human liver microsomes.

     Inhibition of CYP3A-catalyzed midazolam 1'-hydroxylase by various histamine H1 antagonists, including mequitazine, suggested that mequitazine and some other histamine H1 antagonists could also be inhibitors of CYP3A in human liver microsomes.
