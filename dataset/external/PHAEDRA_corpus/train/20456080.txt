Corticosteroid injections are commonly used as effective treatments for a variety of pain disorders. Recently, there has been a greater appreciation of the potential drug interactions between CYP3A4 inhibitors and corticosteroid medications including topical steroid preparations. We report a case of triamcinolone acetonide induced secondary adrenal insufficiency related to impaired CYP3A4 metabolism by coadministration of nefazodone.
