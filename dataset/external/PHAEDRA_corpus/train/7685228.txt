Reversal of gold-induced neutropenia with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF).

We have successfully overcome severe neutropenia in an RA patient treated with gold salts, using granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), reducing the duration of neutropenia and risk of infection. The patient suffered no side effects, and use of G-CSF represents an important addition to the management of a life-threatening drug reaction.
