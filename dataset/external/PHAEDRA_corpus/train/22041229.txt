Serotonin syndrome: take a closer look at the unwell surgical patient.
This article describes the sequence of acute clinical deterioration seen in a head and neck oncology patient who developed serotonin syndrome peri-operatively. It highlights the clinical dilemma that can be encountered when a septic picture masks the onset of serotonin syndrome and reinforces the importance of awareness of the potential interactions and side effects associated with drugs that surgeons prescribe. We discuss the pathophysiology, causal factors, clinical presentation and diagnosis of serotonin syndrome as well as highlighting some of the dilemmas that this condition presents in the surgical setting.
