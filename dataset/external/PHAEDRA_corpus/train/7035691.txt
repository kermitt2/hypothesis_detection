Transient anuria following administration of angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor (SQ 14225) in a patient with renal artery stenosis of the solitary kidney successfully treated with renal autotransplantation.

We report on a patient with renal artery stenosis who had only 1 kidney and in whom acute renal impairment developed with transient anuria after the administration of captopril. Although inhibition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme is considered to be efficient treatment for hypertension associated with chronic renal failure, care should be taken when captopril is administered initially to a patient with decreased renal function, under the conditions of sodium and water depletion. The renovascular hypertension in this patient was treated successfully by renal autotransplantation.
