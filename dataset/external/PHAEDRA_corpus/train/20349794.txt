Cisplatin-induced syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) in a patient with neuroendocrine tumor of the cervix: a case report and review of the literature.

We present a case of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) secondary to cisplatin therapy in a patient with advanced-stage large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the cervix. This occurred after the first cycle of cisplatin and then again after the second cycle. Carboplatin was substituted for cisplatin, and there were no further episodes of SIADH.
