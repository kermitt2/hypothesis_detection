[The effect of cimetidine on the renal excretion of verografin and iodamide in dogs] The intravenous injection of cimetidine in a dose of 20 mg/kg enhanced verografine and iodamide excretion in chronic canine experiments. The higher verografine and iodamide excretion was due to their increased renal tubular secretion. In dogs, cimetidine unchanged the secretion of cardiotrast, a test agent for anionic transport. Possible extrarenal mechanisms of action of cimetidine on verografine and iodamide transport were also examined.
