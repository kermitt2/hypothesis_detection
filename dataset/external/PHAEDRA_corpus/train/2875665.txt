Exacerbation of schizophrenia associated with amantadine.

Administration of amantadine was associated with psychotic decompensations in two schizophrenic patients being maintained on concomitant neuroleptic medication. Despite a postulated dopaminergic mechanism, there seems to have been only one previous report of amantadine's precipitating psychosis in a schizophrenic patient.
