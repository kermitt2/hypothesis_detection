Gold-induced pneumonitis.

Gold-induced pneumonitis is a rare complication of gold salt therapy. We describe a patient with rheumatoid arthritis treated with gold salts, who developed bilateral interstitial pulmonary abnormalities and showed a dramatic response on corticosteroid therapy. Although after 4 weeks of treatment with corticosteroids the chest X-ray and lung function were still abnormal, bronchoalveolar lavage showed a normal cell distribution. Corticosteroid therapy was continued for 8 months since there was still improvement of pulmonary function studies. This case supports the view that in gold-induced pneumonitis a prolonged treatment with corticosteroids may be necessary, as lung function continued to improve.
