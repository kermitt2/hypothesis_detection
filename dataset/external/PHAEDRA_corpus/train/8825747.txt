Loperamide poisoning in the dog.

A retrospective study was conducted of 40 loperamide poisoning cases recorded at the Centre National d'Informations Toxicologiques Veterinaires. An apparent breed susceptibility of Collie dogs was observed. Neurologic disturbances (ataxia and prostration) were significant clinical findings. Treatment with naloxone resulted in rapid reversal of signs without sequelae.
