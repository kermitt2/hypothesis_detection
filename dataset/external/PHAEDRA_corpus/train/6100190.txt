Diagnostic, treatment and aftercare approaches to cocaine abuse. The general public feels that cocaine is not particularly dangerous because it does not produce a well defined physical dependency and abstinence syndrome. However, when addiction is defined as compulsion, loss of control and continued use in spite of adverse consequences, cocaine drug hunger can be seen as an agent of addictive disease. Withdrawal from cocaine dependence usually involves depression, anxiety and lethargy. These usually clear within a week, leaving only the "drug hunger" to contend with. Medication is rarely needed. When cocaine is the primary addiction, after withdrawal the most effective treatment is group therapy with other recovering cocaine abusers. We incorporate the principles of recovery and define positive and constructive alternatives in dealing with cocaine hunger. Recovery programs should be flexible and involve individual and family education on recovery and the nature of addictive disease. Exercise that produces cardiopulmonary stimulation is a helpful means of reducing drug hunger and anxiety during recovery therapy.
