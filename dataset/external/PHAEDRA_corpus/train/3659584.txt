Massive pulmonary embolism complicating streptokinase treatment for deep vein thrombosis.

A fatal massive pulmonary embolus developed in a patient treated with streptokinase for acute deep vein thrombosis. This fatal complication occurred despite a careful selection of the patient and the presence of a lytic state. Embolization of a fragmented thrombus or/and attenuation of the lytic state leading to fresh embolization is/are the possible mechanism(s). Although rare, massive pulmonary embolus must be considered to be a major risk of thrombolytic therapy for deep venous thrombosis.
