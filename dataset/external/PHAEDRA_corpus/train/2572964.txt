Betel nut-induced extrapyramidal syndrome: an unusual drug interaction.
Two cases are described of chronic schizophrenic patients maintained on depot neuroleptics, who developed severe extrapyramidal symptoms following a period of heavy betel nut consumption. A mechanism for this effect is proposed based on the pharmacological antagonism of the anticholinergic agent, procyclidine, by the active alkaloid ingredient of the betel, arecoline.
