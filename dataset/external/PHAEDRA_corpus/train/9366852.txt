Skin necrosis secondary to low-molecular weight heparin in a patient with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.

Skin necrosis is a rare complication of subcutaneous heparin therapy that usually occurs at injection sites. It occasionally accompanies the heparin-associated thrombocytopenia and thrombosis syndrome. We describe a patient with the antiphospholipid syndrome who had skin necrosis develop from low-molecular weight heparin therapy at sites distant from injection sites.
