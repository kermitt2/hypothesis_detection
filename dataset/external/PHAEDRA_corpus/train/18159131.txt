Distinct effects of omeprazole and rabeprazole on the tacrolimus blood concentration in a kidney transplant recipient.
Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs, e.g. omeprazole and rabeprazole) are often administered to transplant patients as a treatment or prophylaxis for ulcers after surgery. Since tacrolimus and PPIs share the CYP3A4 system for metabolism, pharmacokinetic interactions are anticipated when they are administered simultaneously. We present a Japanese male patient who underwent a living-donor kidney transplantation having received tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisolone for immunosuppression. The concentration/dose (C/D) ratio for tacrolimus was markedly higher during the period of treatment with omeprazole than ranitidine or rabeprazole. The results of liver functional tests were within the normal range during the use of these three antacid drugs. Since the higher C/D ratio for tacrolimus when omeprazole was being administered did not result from a decrease in the elimination of tacrolimus due to hepatic dysfunction, drug interaction between omeprazole and tacrolimus was strongly suspected. The present case indicates that rabeprazole can be used safely in place of omeprazole in kidney transplant recipients receiving tacrolimus.
