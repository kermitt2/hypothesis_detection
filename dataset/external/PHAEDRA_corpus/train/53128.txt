Airway obstruction due to spontaneous retropharyngeal hemorrhage.

A patient is described with polycythemia vera who was taking anticoagulants and developed a spontaneous retropharyngeal hemorrhage after a violent sneezing episode. This progressed to tracheal compression with stridor after he had taken some aspirin for relief of the neck pain. An emergency tracheostomy was life saving.
