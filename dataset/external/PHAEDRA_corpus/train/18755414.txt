Hemorrhage from a falx meningioma after internal use of low-dose aspirin.

We report a case in which hemorrhage occurred in an asymptomatic falx meningioma known beforehand, after the internal use of low-dose aspirin for 16 months. Our case is the second one in which hemorrhage from a meningioma may have been induced by aspirin prophylaxis. On the other hand, aspirin may have promoted the enlargement of spontaneous hemorrhage from meningioma. Furthermore, inadequate control of hypertension may have been another cause of hemorrhage. Although it is difficult to solely attribute intratumoral hemorrhage to aspirin, we have to be careful when prescribing aspirin for patients who have asymptomatic meningioma.
