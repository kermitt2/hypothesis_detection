Gold-induced aplastic anemia.

Three patients receiving gold salt treatment for rheumatoid arthritis developed severe aplastic anemia. All three patients experienced remission of their disease at the time of the occurrence of marrow aplasia. Reviewing data on these patients and recent literature indicate that fatal marrow aplasia seems to occur more frequently in sero-negative women who respond well to therapy with gold salts. Frequent blood monitoring in search for any pronounced or sustained drop in red, white or platelet count, even within normal range could serve as a warning sign for myelotoxicity. Despite intensive supportive measures and specific therapeutic attempts, all three patients eventually died of septic shock.
