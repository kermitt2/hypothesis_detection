Single case study. Amoxapine, a new antidepressant, appears in human milk.

A young woman developed galactorrhea during treatment with a new dibenzoxazepine antidepressant, amoxapine. Both amoxapine and its active and major metabolite, 8-OH-amoxapine, appeared in breast milk. More recent literature suggests that probably all antidepressants can appear in human milk.
