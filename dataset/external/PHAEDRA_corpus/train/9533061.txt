Clostridium difficile toxin-induced colitis after use of clindamycin phosphate vaginal cream.

OBJECTIVE: To report a case of toxin-positive Clostridium difficile-induced colitis (CDIC) after use of clindamycin phosphate vaginal cream.
CASE SUMMARY: A 25-year-old postpartum white woman developed multiple watery stools and abdominal cramping on day 6 of therapy with clindamycin vaginal cream for bacterial vaginosis. She received no other concomitant medications. The patient's stool sample was found to be positive for the C. difficile toxin. Due to the costs and risks of standard therapy, we decided to manage the patient supportively. Complete resolution of the diarrhea occurred shortly thereafter.
DISCUSSION: No published clinical studies in patients receiving clindamycin vaginal cream for bacterial vaginosis have documented C. difficile toxin in stool samples of patients with diarrhea. Approximately 5-6% of intravaginal clindamycin is absorbed in the bloodstream, making systemic effects possible.
CONCLUSIONS: This report indicates clindamycin phosphate vaginal cream as the most probable cause of CDIC due to the temporal relationship between the occurrence of diarrhea and clindamycin administration, lack of concomitant medications, and documentation of C. difficile toxin.
