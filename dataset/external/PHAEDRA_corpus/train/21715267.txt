Interaction study of moxifloxacin and lomefloxacin with co-administered drugs. Moxifloxacin and lomefloxacin are fluoroquinolone antibiotics used in treating urinary and respiratory tract infections. Fluoroquinolones are known to have interactions with drugs that are active in gastro intestinal tract. Being moxifloxacin and lomefloxacin fluoroquinolones the interaction study of was carried out with sucralfate, gelusil, erythromycin and multi minerals. The interaction was studied at neutral, acidic and basic conditions both at room temperature and 37  C. The effect of dissolution medium simulating various body environments with response to pH has been examined in order to elucidate the interactions. The response of moxifloxacin and lomefloxacin after interaction with co-administered drugs at different conditions and temperature were noted using a Shimadzu HPLC system with PDA detector. It was seen that interaction of these fluoroquinolones was more at 37  C than at room temperature. Moxifloxacin and Lomefloxacin reacts faster with sucralfate and gelusil in acidic media whereas with erythromycin in basic media and multi-minerals in neutral media. The study ensures the interaction of fluoroquinolones with selected class of drugs. In order to achieve the effective therapeutic effect appropriate time intervals between administrations of drugs is essential.
