Simultaneous toxicities in a child on multiple anticonvulsants.
It is rare to develop simultaneous toxicities while on anticonvulsants. This article presents a 3(1/2)-year-old child on valproic acid, lamotrigine, and phenytoin who developed simultaneous hepatotoxicity and bone marrow toxicity during a parainfluenza virus type 3 infection. These toxicities resolved after the cessation of anticonvulsants, and her seizures were managed acutely with scheduled lorazepam. This article discusses the possibility that simultaneous use of valproic acid, lamotrigine, and phenytoin could give this combination of toxicities and that concurrent viral infection may increase this risk.
