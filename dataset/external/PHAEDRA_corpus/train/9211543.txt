Bleomycin and cyclophosphamide toxicity simulating metastatic nodules to the lungs in childhood cancer.

Two pediatric oncology patients with Ewing's sarcoma and one with mixed germ cell tumor were treated with drug regimens that included bleomycin or cyclophosphamide. Despite progress to apparently complete remission, all manifested pulmonary nodules on computed tomography during or at the end of treatment. Thoracoscopic biopsy to confirm metastasis revealed instead fibrotic lesions apparently attributable to bleomycin or cyclophosphamide. After cessation of chemotherapy, the pulmonary lesions resolved and all three patients sustained their remissions. The case histories and comments on the diagnosis and management of pulmonary nodules are reviewed.
