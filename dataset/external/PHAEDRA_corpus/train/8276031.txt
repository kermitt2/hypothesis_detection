Imidazoline intoxication in children.

A 15-month-old girl with rhinopharyngitis was treated with a nasal solution containing the imidazoline derivative naphazoline. She rapidly developed profound CNS depression with stupor, hypothermia, hypoventilation and bradycardia. All symptoms disappeared within 24 h. The symptomatology of 18 other paediatric cases of naphthylimidazoline exposure reported to the Belgian National Poison Centre, is also discussed. Imidazoline intoxication due to overdose or accidental ingestion but also after normal therapeutic usage is frequent in children. It can cause severe CNS depression, especially in very young children. For these reasons vasoconstrictor imidazoline containing solutions should be prescribed with caution and kept out of reach of children.
