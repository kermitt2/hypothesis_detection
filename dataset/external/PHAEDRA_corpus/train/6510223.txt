Chlorpropamide-induced hemolytic anemia.

Acute intravascular hemolysis developed when a diabetic patient, previously treated with glyburide, was started on another oral sulfonylurea drug, chlorpropamide. Immunoglobulins were not found in the patient's serum and the red cells were coated with C3 only, suggesting an "innocent bystander" reaction. This case demonstrates that there is no cross reactivity between glyburide and chlorpropamide in producing hemolytic anemia.
