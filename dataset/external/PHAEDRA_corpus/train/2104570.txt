Secondary hematologic neoplasm after intravesical chemotherapy for superficial bladder carcinoma.

Two cases are reported of patients who developed a hematologic malignancy several years after intravesical chemotherapy of superficial bladder cancer with etoglucid, doxorubicin, and mitomycin C. In one patient, karyotypic abnormalities (-5, 7q-) typical of a therapy induced malignancy were associated with rapid progression of a refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation to an acute non-lymphocytic leukemia. Intravesical chemotherapy may be associated with a risk of secondary malignancy.
