Intracranial haemorrhage from a meningioma in a patient receiving aspirin prophylaxis: a case report.

A case of acute subdural haematoma originating spontaneously from an angiomatous meningioma in a patient receiving prophylactic aspirin therapy is presented. To the best of our knowledge no comparable case and no discussion of possible complications of aspirin prophylaxis in patients with brain tumours have been published. Possible reasons and clinical significance of this complication are discussed. This observation questions the suitability of aspirin as prophylaxis for vascular disease in patients with meningiomas.
