Serotonin syndrome following cardiac surgery.
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are widely used to treat depression. We report a case of serotonin syndrome following cardiac surgery. This syndrome is rare in the cardiac literature. The clinical features, diagnosis and management of this unusual syndrome are described. In patients with polypharmacy, it is important to take cognisance of serotonergic antidepressants and anticipate their potential interactions with drugs used peri-operatively. Early recognition and treatment is important as this condition is potentially fatal.
