Induction of systemic lupus erythematosus by interferon-gamma in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis.

The development of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) after 38 months of therapy with recombinant human interferon gamma (rIFN-gamma) was observed in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis. In addition to glomerulonephritis and a butterfly rash, previously negative tests for antinuclear, anti-dsDNA and anti-Sm antibodies became positive. We assume that rIFN-gamma induced the de novo development of SLE in our patient.
