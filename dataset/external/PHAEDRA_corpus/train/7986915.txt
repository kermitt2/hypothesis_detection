Amebic abscess of the spleen complicated by metronidazole-induced neurotoxicity: case report.

We describe a patient with a liver abscess due to Entamoeba histolytica, in whom metronidazole therapy (total dose, 21 g over 14 days) was complicated by reversible deafness, tinnitus, and ataxia and who relapsed 5 months later with a splenic abscess. Two courses of tinidazole (the second in combination with percutaneous aspiration of the abscess) were required to achieve cure.
