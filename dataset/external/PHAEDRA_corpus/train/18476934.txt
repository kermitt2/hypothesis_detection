Transient bilateral blindness and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome: a rare complication of enuresis treatment.

Enuresis is a common paediatric problem which is sometimes treated with anticholinergic drugs. We report a 4-year-old girl who presented with acute bilateral blindness, a focal seizure and hypertension 10 days after commencing oxybutynin to treat enuresis. Magnetic resonance imaging brain showed features of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, a recognised but rare complication of hypertension in children. Discontinuing the oxybutynin leads to complete neurological recovery associated with normalisation of her blood pressure. We believe this case represents a rare complication of anticholinergic therapy. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome is a treatable and reversible cause of acute encephalopathy with blindness, as long as an early diagnosis is made.
