Severe bleomycin lung toxicity: reversal with high dose corticosteroids.

A 42 year old man, treated for testicular carcinoma with combination chemotherapy that included bleomycin, developed life threatening interstitial pneumonitis. He recovered successfully after treatment with very high doses of corticosteroids and azathioprine. This report suggests that bleomycin lung toxicity may be reversible if treated aggressively.
