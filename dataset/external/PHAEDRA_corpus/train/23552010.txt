Acute angioedema response to topical 5-fluorouracil therapy.
This is a case report involving a patient who was treated with topical 5-FU cream and subsequently developed a severe case of angioedema. This case presents the possibility of anaphylaxis to topical 5-FU treatments and/or the interaction with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. To our knowledge there has been no prior reported case of this reaction. We present this unusual case along with a review of the current literature on angioedema.
