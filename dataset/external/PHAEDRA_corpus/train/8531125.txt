     Potent and selective inactivation of human liver microsomal cytochrome P-450 isoforms by L-754,394, an investigational human immune deficiency virus protease inhibitor.


 L-754,394, N- [2(R)-hydroxy-1(S)-indanyl]-5- [2(S)-(1,1-dimethylethylaminocarbonyl)-4-  [(furo [2,3-b]pyridin-5-yl)methyl]piperazin-1-yl]-4(S)-hydroxy-2(R) - phenylmethylpentanamide, is a potent and specific inhibitor of the human immune deficiency virus (HIV) protease.

     The drug selectively inhibited human liver microsomal CYP 3A4-dependent testosterone 6 beta-hydroxylase and CYP 2D6-dependent bufuralol 1'-hydroxylase activities in a time- and concentration-dependent manner in the presence of an NADPH-generating system.


     L-754,394 was found to be a very potent inactivator of CYP 3A4.

     Thus, for testosterone 6 beta-hydroxylase, the inactivation kinetic constants, Kl and kinact, were 7.5 microM and 1.62 min-1, respectively, and the partition ratio (moles product formed per moles enzyme inactivated) was approximately 1.35.

     To a lesser extent, L-754,394 also was an inactivator of CYP 2D6, for which the corresponding values for Kl, kinact and partition ratio were 32 microM, 0.18 min-1 and 40, respectively.


     CYP 3A4 inactivation was reduced markedly by ketoconazole, a selective CYP 3A4 inhibitor.


     Similarly, CYP 2D6 inactivation also was prevented by quinidine, a specific competitive inhibitor of this isoform.

     However, exogenously added nucleophiles (GSH, semicarbazide and N-acetylcysteine) failed to protect against P-450 inactivation.
     These results suggest that the inactivation process likely is mediated by a reactive metabolite of L-754,394 that alkylates, and thereby destroys, the enzyme.
     Furthermore, this electrophilic intermediate may not be released into the medium before the inactivation event.
