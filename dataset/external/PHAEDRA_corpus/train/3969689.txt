Increased hepatotoxicity of acetaminophen by concomitant administration of caffeine in the rat. Since caffeine is frequently co-administered with acetaminophen, it is of clinical interest to study the effect of caffeine on the hepatotoxicity of acetaminophen. In male Sprague-Dawley rats fasted for 18 h, concomitant administration of caffeine (0.1 g/kg, i.p.) as judged by increased serum enzyme activities and increased incidence of hepatic necrosis. Careful observations on hepatotoxicity are suggested when acetaminophen is prescribed with caffeine.
