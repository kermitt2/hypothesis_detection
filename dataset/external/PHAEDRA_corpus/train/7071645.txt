Membranous nephropathy in rheumatoid arthritis.

We have described a man with classic rheumatoid arthritis who had membranous nephropathy associated with nephrotic syndrome not related to gold or penicillamine therapy. Complete remission of the nephrosis occurred after discontinuation of hydroxychloroquine therapy. Further study is needed to determine the incidence of subclinical membranous nephropathy in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and the effect of drugs in triggering clinical manifestations of this condition.
