Outcome of pregnancy in women treated with all-trans retinoic acid; a case report and review of literature.

All-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) has been proved to be an effective treatment for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), inducing remission in more than 90% of cases. Treatment of APL in pregnancy is controversial as the use of ATRA has been questioned due to the teratogenic effect of retinoids. We report a case of pregnancy in a woman exposed to ATRA during the first trimester. The baby was born healthy, without any anomalies. Review of all reported cases of the use of ATRA in pregnancy revealed no serious adverse outcomes or congenital anomalies although only very few cases had exposure in the first trimester.
