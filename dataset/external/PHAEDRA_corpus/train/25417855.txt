Worsening pneumonitis due to a pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction between everolimus and voriconazole in a renal transplant patient.
Azole antifungals, prescribed prophylactically to avoid severe infections in immunosuppressed organ transplant recipients, can interact with drug substrates of CYP3A4. We report serious adverse effects due to interaction between orally administered voriconazole and everolimus in a renal transplant recipient.
Despite reduction of the dose of everolimus by a third, the blood trough concentration of everolimus increased considerably in a kidney transplant recipient upon oral administration of voriconazole. Everolimus was then discontinued. Pneumonia secondary to pulmonary aspergillosis worsened, possibly due to the excessive immunosuppression.
Orally administered voriconazole inhibits intestinal and hepatic cytochrome P450-3A4 activity and thereby reduces everolimus metabolism. An 80% decrease in dose or discontinuation of everolimus is required when concomitant voriconazole is introduced. Daily blood monitoring of everolimus is warranted until a steady state of concentrations is reached.
