Generalized lichen nitidus with involvement of the palms following interferon alpha treatment.

Lichen nitidus is an uncommon dermatosis of unknown etiology. Here we present the case of a generalized lichen nitidus with involvement of the palms in a patient with hepatitis C after systemic treatment with interferon alpha and ribavirin. Furthermore in our patient we could show a strong lesional expression of MxA, a protein specifically induced by type I interferon. It is tempting to speculate that interferon alpha may be involved in the pathogenesis of lichen nitidus.
