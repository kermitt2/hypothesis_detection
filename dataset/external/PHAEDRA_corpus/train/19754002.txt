Mood stabilizer therapy and pravastatin: higher risk for adverse skin reactions?
We report on a serious side effect in a severely depressed 55-year-old woman, who presented an erythematous pigmented skin rash on the whole body under combination treatment with antidepressants, atypical antipsychotic drugs, the mood stabilizer lithium and the lipid-lowering drug pravastatin. The skin rash effect was most probably due, in first line, to olanzapine, but the cutaneous skin condition was triggered and aggravated by pravastatin, a 3-hydoxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A-(HMG-CoA)-reductase inhibitor, and lithium medication. The allergic reaction started to develop after co-administration of pravastatin. Therefore, the combination of atypical antipsychotics with statins should be carefully monitored and the benefits and disadvantages should be balanced.
