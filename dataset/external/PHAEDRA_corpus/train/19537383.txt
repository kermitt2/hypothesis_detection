Localized dyskeratotic plaque with milia associated with sorafenib.

Sorafenib, a multitargeted kinase inhibitor used for the treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma and advanced renal cell carcinomas, received FDA approval in 2005. Since its introduction to the market, there have been various dermatologic side effects reported in the literature, the most well known being hand-foot skin reaction. This article presents a case of an atypical localized cutaneous eruption with an unusual course and protracted resolution time associated with sorafenib therapy.
