Graft versus host-like illness in a child with phenobarbital hypersensitivity.

A child in whom a phenobarbital hypersensitivity drug reaction developed which consisted of fever, a pruritic desquamating erythrodermic rash, alopecia, icterus, protein-losing enteropathy, myositis, and nephritis, is described. Laboratory studies demonstrated eosinophilia, elevated serum IgE, and elevated T suppressor/cytotoxic cells in the peripheral blood. Findings from biopsy specimens of skin and jejunum suggested a cell-mediated pathogenesis, and lymphoproliferative studies of the patient's mononuclear cells revealed a positive response to phenobarbital. The clinical findings and laboratory studies suggested an autoimmune cell-mediated hypersensitivity reaction triggered by phenobarbital.
