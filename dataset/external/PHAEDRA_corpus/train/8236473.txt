Prosthetic valve dysfunction in a Nigerian.
A case is presented of a mechanical cardiac valve dysfunction occurring in a 19-year-old Nigerian 7 years after valve surgery and presenting with cardiac failure, supraventricular tachycardia and later, cardiogenic shock but initially masquerading as generalised bleeding probably from Warfarin-drug interaction. The problem of management of an artificial heart valve in our setting is discussed.
