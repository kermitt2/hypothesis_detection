Transient hemiparesis caused by phenytoin toxicity. A case report.

A 52-year-old Black woman on phenytoin therapy for post-traumatic epilepsy developed transient hemiparesis contralateral to the injury. The episode appeared to have been precipitated by toxicity due to ingestion of a large amount of phenytoin. A possible mechanism for focal neurological deficit in brain-damaged patients on phenytoin therapy is discussed.
