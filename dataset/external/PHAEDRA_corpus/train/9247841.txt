Propylthiouracil-induced cutaneous vasculitis.

Cutaneous reactions to propylthiouracil and methimazole occur in 3%-5% of adults. Generalized maculopapular and papular purpuric eruptions are perhaps the most common thionamide-induced reactions. We report 3 patients who developed cutaneous vasculitis which is a rare and serious side-effect during antithyroid drug therapy. The observation of cutaneous vasculitis during administration of propylthiouracil suggested that clinical awareness of this complication should be of considerable importance.
