Cryptococcus neoformans fatal sepsis in a chronic lymphocytic leukemia patient treated with alemtuzumab: case report and review of the literature.

Cryptococcosis is a disseminated fungal disease typically associated with immunosuppression and characterized by high mortality rates. Cryptococcus neoformans has been reported to be isolated from blood cultures in around 20% of patients with cryptococcosis, and cryptococcemia has been correlated with poor prognosis. We report a case of fatal C. neoformans fungemia in a neutropenic patient with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia treated with alemtuzumab. The patient presented with loss of consciousness and died after 5 days of antifungal therapy with liposomal amphotericin B. The international literature regarding opportunistic infections after immunosuppressive therapy with alemtuzumab with particular attention on fungal infections has also been reviewed.
