An autopsy case of multiple psychotropic drug poisoning. A fatal poisoning case involving etizolam, phenobarbital, promethazine and chlorpromazine is presented. Quantitative toxicological analysis showed that the concentrations of etizolam, phenobarbital, promethazine and chlorpromazine in the femoral blood were 86 ng/ml, 5082 microg/ml, 0.107 microg/ml and 0.144 microg/ml, respectively, and large amounts of drugs were also detected in the stomach contents. We conclude that the cause of death was due to the interaction of multiple psychotropic drugs.
