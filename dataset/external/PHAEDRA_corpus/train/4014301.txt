Insulin-induced cardiac failure.

Self-limited edema is a well-recognized complication of insulin therapy. However, progression to overt cardiac failure has only recently been reported in one patient with pre-existing heart disease. This report describes the first case of insulin-induced cardiac failure in a patient without underlying heart disease. Current trends toward intensive insulin therapy for rapid near-normalization of blood glucose levels will increase the recognition of this entity. Careful follow-up of so-called "self-limited" insulin edema is encouraged, and the early institution of diuretic therapy is advocated in elderly patients to prevent the development of overt cardiac failure.
