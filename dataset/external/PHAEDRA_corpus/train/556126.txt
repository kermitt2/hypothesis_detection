Pituitary tumor made symptomatic during hormone therapy and induced pregnancy.

An infertile patient with amenorrhea-galactorrhea syndrome lost vision during a pregnancy occurring after Bromocryptine treatment. A pituitary adenoma was removed, vision recovered, and the pregnancy completed successfully. Two prior episodes of visual loss had occurred during oral contraceptive treatment, an association not heretofore reported. Intrasellar and parasellar tumors made manifest by hormonal influences of pregnancy may become more common as treatment of infertility becomes more refined and successful.
