Aplastic anemia and agranulocytosis in patients using methazolamide for glaucoma.

Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors used in the treatment of glaucoma, seizure disorders, and hypertension are rarely associated with blood dyscrasias. Several case reports of aplastic anemia with use of acetazolamide, and two cases with use of methazolamide, have appeared in the literature. This article describes two cases of aplastic anemia, at least one of which was almost certainly induced by the use of methazolamide, and one case of agranulocytosis related to the use of methazolamide.
