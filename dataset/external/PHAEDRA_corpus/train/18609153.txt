Terlipressin-induced ventricular arrhythmia.

During intravenous treatment with terlipressin for recurrent gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, a 50-year-old male with no history of heart disease developed a newly prolonged QT interval and torsade de pointes. Risk factors present for acquired long QT syndrome were mineral dysbalance and a history of alcohol abuse with hepatic impairment. The patient was brought back to a normal sinus rhythm after a single 300-J counter-shock. Terlipressin was discontinued, and the patient's QTc interval subsequently returned to baseline. During 6 weeks of monitoring, arrhythmia did not recur.
