Morphea after bromocriptine therapy.

A 57-year-old man developed morphea while taking bromocriptine. This drug is a semisynthetic ergot alkaloid, one of a class of drugs that is associated with fibrotic disorders. Other agents known for such association are serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) and beta-adrenergic blockers. A common pathogenesis to link these agents to fibrosis remains uncertain.
