Flumazenil reversal of benzodiazepine-induced sedation for a patient with severe pre-ECT anxiety.

We describe various measures to reduce severe anxiety that interfered with much-needed maintenance electroconvulsive therapy in a 32-year-old man. Treatment with ketamine met with moderate success, and then large doses of lorazepam and midazalam were used. The potential anticonvulsant effect of these drugs was successfully reversed by the administration of intravenous flumazenil just prior to the treatments.
