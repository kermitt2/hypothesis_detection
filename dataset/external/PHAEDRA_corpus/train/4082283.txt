Rifampicin-induced renal failure.

Renal failure is a rare complication associated with the use of rifampicin for the treatment of tuberculosis, usually occurring well into the course of therapy. The following is a report of 2 cases of rifampicin-induced renal insufficiency. In the first case oligo-anuric renal failure occurred on the thirteenth day of treatment, after the patient had taken only 9 doses of medication. The second case occurred in a patient who developed renal failure while on daily therapy in the hospital. A literature review revealed 83 other reported cases of rifampicin-induced renal insufficiency. Intermittent or interrupted therapy appears to be a significant risk factor for the development of this complication.
