Rifampin-associated thrombocytopenia secondary to poor compliance.

Rifampin can be associated with severe adverse effects such as hepatitis, acute renal failure, hemolytic anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Thrombocytopenia has traditionally been associated with intermittent therapy. This article reports the occurrence of rifampin-associated thrombocytopenia in an indigent patient after a four-month lapse in therapy for pulmonary tuberculosis. The patient's platelet count dropped rapidly to a level of 1000/mm3 after receiving a single 600 mg dose of rifampin. After returning to a normal level of greater than 100,000/mm3, the patient's platelets again dropped to 1200/mm3 with readministration of rifampin. The long-term therapy necessary to eradicate the Mycobacterium tuberculosis organism makes economic considerations important. This patient and other indigent patients who may be poor compliers because they are unable to buy the necessary medication may be at a higher risk for adverse reactions.
