Schizophrenia-like psychosis caused by a metabolic disorder.

Four patients with an intermittent psychosis closely resembling hallucinogenic drug-induced states were suspected of having a porphyric disease and were investigated for a possible relation between the metabolic dysfunctions of porphyria and the psychotic syndrome. Theoretically the link could be in a disturbance of serine and glycine metabolism. This theory was supported by disturbances in serine and glycine excretion found in all patients during psychotic episodes. In addition, loading with one low oral dose of serine produced psychotic symptoms 5 h later which lasted 3-6 h. One patient reacted to glycine in the same way. These findings suggest that disturbed serine-glycine metabolism may have a key role in certain schizophreniform psychotic syndromes.
