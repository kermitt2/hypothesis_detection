Rocuronium antagonized by sugammadex for series of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in a patient with pseudocholinesterase deficiency.
We report the anesthetic management of a patient with catatonic schizophrenia and pseudocholinesterase deficiency, using the nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking drug, rocuronium, reversed by its specific reversal agent, sugammadex, for a series of electroconvulsive therapy sessions. Rocuronium and sugammadex were used every 48 hours for 8 consecutive times and proved to be an effective and safe combination in a situation where succinylcholine was contraindicated.
