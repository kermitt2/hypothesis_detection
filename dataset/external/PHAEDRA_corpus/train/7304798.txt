Induction of rapid mood cycling during L-dopa treatment in a bipolar patient.

The authors report a longitudinal case study of a woman with a history of bipolar affective disorder in which L-dopa shortened the manic-depressive cycle length when administered in a double-blind trial. This finding suggests a dopaminergic mechanism specifically in changing the frequency of cycling between depression and mania.
