 Itraconazole decreases renal clearance of digoxin.


 Itraconazole strongly interacts with some drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4, for example, felodipine and lovastatin, by inhibiting their metabolism.
 A concomitant use of itraconazole increases the serum concentrations of digoxin, although digoxin is excreted mainly unchanged in urine.
 To reveal the mechanism of the itraconazole-digoxin interaction, the effect of itraconazole on the serum concentrations and urinary excretion of digoxin was studied.
 Ten healthy volunteers in a double-blind, randomized, two-phase crossover study received either 200 mg itraconazole or placebo orally once a day for 5 days.
 On day 3, each volunteer ingested a single 0.5-mg oral dose of digoxin.
 The serum concentrations of digoxin and its excretion into urine as well as plasma concentrations of itraconazole were determined up to 72 hours after dosing.

     The mean area under the serum digoxin concentration-time curve, AUC(0-72), was approximately 50% higher (P < 0.001) during the itraconazole phase than during the placebo phase.


     In addition, the renal clearance of digoxin decreased about 20% (P < 0.01) by itraconazole.


     The increases in digoxin Cmax and t(1/2) by itraconazole were not statistically significant.


     The decreased renal clearance of digoxin during the itraconazole phase partially explains increased concentrations of digoxin during their concomitant use and may be caused by the inhibition of P-glycoprotein-mediated digoxin secretion in the renal tubular cells.
