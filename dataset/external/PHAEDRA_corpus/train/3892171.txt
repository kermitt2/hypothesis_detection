Protamine-induced fatal anaphylaxis. Prevalence of antiprotamine immunoglobulin E antibody.

Protamine is used widely to reverse the anticoagulant effects of heparin and to delay the absorption of insulin. Although adverse reactions to protamine are reported infrequently and are usually mild, we recently observed the first fatal case of type I anaphylaxis resulting from protamine. This patient had previously been sensitized to protamine during cardiac catheterization and had high levels of protamine-specific immunoglobulin E in the serum. In a prospective study, we found that 10 of 19 diabetic patients (53%) who had received insulin containing insulin also had high levels of antiprotamine immunoglobulin E. In contrast, none of 27 nondiabetic healthy normal controls or 10 diabetics who had never received protamine or protamine-containing insulin had levels of antiprotamine immunoglobulin E over background. This study underscores the risks of routinely administering protamine to susceptible individuals and the need for alternative therapies.
