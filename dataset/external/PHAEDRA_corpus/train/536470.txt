Interaction between sulindac and warfarin: different results in normal subjects and in an unusual patient with a potassium-losing renal tubular defect.
While sulindac failed to affect significantly warfarin-induced hypoprothrombinemia in normal male volunteers, it markedly prolonged prothrombin time in a patient with a renal tubular defect who had been anticoagulated with warfarin. This difference in individual response with respect to a drug interaction illustrates the need to adjust information on drug interactions to the particular clinical circumstances and conditions under which drugs are coadministered.
