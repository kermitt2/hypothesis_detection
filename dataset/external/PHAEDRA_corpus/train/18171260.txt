Serotonin syndrome after concomitant treatment with linezolid and meperidine.
Serotonin syndrome has been reported with administration of linezolid and serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Meperidine blocks the neuronal reuptake of serotonin. Serotonin syndrome after concomitant linezolid and meperidine therapy has not been described. We describe serotonin syndrome after concomitant use of linezolid and meperidine in a 27-year-old man with acute leukemia.
