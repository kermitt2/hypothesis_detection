Bulbar and pseudobulbar palsy complicating therapy with high-dose cytosine arabinoside in children with leukemia.

Three of 38 children given high-dose cytosine arabinoside therapy developed a previously undescribed complication. Neurological problems are a frequent occurrence in patients given this therapy, particularly cerebellar ataxia, but the development of bulbar and pseudobulbar palsy has not been reported. In two of these cases, it was sufficiently marked for the course of treatment to be curtailed and occurred at a relatively low cumulative dose of the drug. Neurotoxicity can occur at any time using high-dose cytosine therapy.
