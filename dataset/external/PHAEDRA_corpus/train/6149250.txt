A call for caution in the use of aminoglutethimide: negative interactions with dexamethasone and beta blocker treatment.
Two case reports are described, both breast carcinoma patients with metastatic disease. One of the patients had a dexamethasone dependent brain metastatic condition. The second patient suffered from high blood pressure, which was controlled with beta-blocker drugs. Both patients developed severe complications when treated with aminoglutethimide as a cancer hormonal therapy. The case reports are described and possible drug interaction mechanisms are discussed.
