Disseminated muscular cysticercosis with myositis induced by praziquantel therapy.

Cysticercosis, the infestation with the encysted larval stage of Taenia solium, is increasingly recognized as a major problem in most countries in Latin America, Asia, and Africa, involving mainly the central nervous system. Muscle involvement is also common, although it usually remains asymptomatic. We describe a case of disseminated muscular cysticercosis followed by myositis (fever, diffuse myalgia, weakness of the lower limbs, and inflammatory reaction around dying cysticerci) induced by praziquantel therapy, an event not described previously.
