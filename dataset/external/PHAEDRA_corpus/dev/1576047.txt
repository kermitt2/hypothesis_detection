 Stereoselective genetically-determined interaction between chronic flecainide and quinidine in patients with arrhythmias.


 1.
 Recent reports have indicated a role for the P450IID6 polymorphism in the stereoselective disposition of single doses of the antiarrhythmic flecainide.
 2.
 In this study, we evaluated the effects of adding low dose quinidine, a potent inhibitor of P450IID6, to chronic flecainide therapy in patients with arrhythmias.
 3.

     In five extensive metabolizer patients, quinidine significantly reduced the clearance of R-(-)-flecainide, from 395 +/- 121 (s.d.) to 335 +/- 88 ml min-1.

 This change was attributable to a decrease in metabolic clearance, was accompanied by decreased formation of the two major metabolites of flecainide and was not observed in a poor metabolizer subject.
 The renal clearance of R-(-)-flecainide rose significantly.
 4.

     Quinidine did not alter the clearance of S-(+)-flecainide.

 5.
 The pharmacologic effects of flecainide therapy (QRS widening, % arrhythmia suppression) were slightly, but not significantly, increased.
 6.
 In extensive metabolizer patients receiving chronic flecainide, increased plasma concentration will develop if P450IID6 is inhibited.
