Trans-catheter hepatic arterial injection of lipiodol soluble anti-cancer agent SMANCS and ADR suspension in lipiodol combined with arterial embolization and local hyperthermia for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.

The clinical effect and safety of Lp-TAE alone and combined with radiofrequency (RF) capacitive hyperthermia (HT) were evaluated in 20 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) associated with cirrhosis of the liver. After the oily carcinostatic agents were administered by Lp-TAE, HT, at a temperature of greater than 42.5 degrees C, was induced for 40 min, twice a week by an RF of 8 MHz for a total of 10 to 38 times. The response rate was 40% in the 10 cases that were treated with Lp-TAE combined with HT and 20% in the 10 cases that were treated with Lp-TAE. The patients who were treated with Lp-TAE combined with HT had a tendency to have better survival rates than those of the Lp-TAE group (p less than 0.099). The main side-effects of Lp-TAE combined with HT were low-grade fever, localized pain, myelo-suppression and liver dysfunction, but these were transient and eventually disappeared.
