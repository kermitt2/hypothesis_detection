Treatment-related myelodysplastic syndrome after temozolomide for recurrent high-grade glioma.

In patients with recurrent malignant glioma, treatment-related myelodysplastic syndrome (t-MDS) and acute leukemia are rare adverse effects because the median survival after relapse is limited. We report a 44-year-old woman with t-MDS (refractory anemia with excess blasts) following treatment of recurrent anaplastic astrocytoma with temozolomide (TMZ). A cytogenetic study showed del (3)(q11.1). MDS was diagnosed 8.4 months after beginning TMZ. The disease rapidly evolved into acute leukemia within 1 month after the onset of MDS, and the patient died 1 month later during induction chemotherapy. The prognosis of t-MDS is generally poor. Considering the increasing use of TMZ, which is regarded as a drug with moderate toxicity, careful follow-up with routine blood testing is vital.
