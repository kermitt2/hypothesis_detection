Seizure with hyponatremia in a child prescribed desmopressin for nocturnal enuresis.

We report a case of hyponatremia associated with a grand mal seizure in a 28 month-old child after intra-nasal desmopressin administration for high fluid intake with nocturnal enuresis. In view of the temporary symptomatic action and the seriousness of certain side-effects of desmopressin we recommend that desmopressin be used with caution in childhood enuresis.
