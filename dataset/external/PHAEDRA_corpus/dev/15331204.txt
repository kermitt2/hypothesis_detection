Possible induction of diabetes by treatment of hypertension with indapamide (with four case reports).

OBJECTIVE: To study therapy with indapamide impairing carbohydrate metabolism in essential hypertension patients and achieve earlier prevention, diagnoses and treatment of diabetes induced by indapamide.
METHODS: Four cases of essential hypertension patients (1 male and 3 females) were observed through process of therapy with indapamide and laboratory investigations.
RESULTS: After 4- to 14-month period of therapy with the combination of indapamide (2.5 mg/day) and fosinopril (10 mg/day) in three patients and 6-month period of monotherapy with indapamide (2.5 mg/day) in one patient, glucose levels of all patients increased and achieve criteria of diabetes diagnoses. After 3- to 13-month period of therapy without indapamide, glucose levels of all patients decreased and diabetes disappeared.
CONCLUSION: Therapy with indapamide may induce diabetes in essential hypertension patients. After stopping indapamide, glucose tolerance impairing may be reversed.
