Ciclesonide reduces the need for oral steroid use in adult patients with severe, persistent asthma.
Oral corticosteroids (OCS) may be associated with systemic adverse events (AEs), which can be reduced by replacing OCS with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). The potential of ciclesonide, a novel ICS, to reduce OCS use in patients with severe, persistent asthma was evaluated in this study.
A phase III, 12-week, international, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study.
Adult and adolescent patients (> or = 12 years old; n = 141) with severe, persistent, oral steroid (prednisone)-dependent asthma.
Patients were randomized to receive ciclesonide (640 mug/d or 1,280 microg/d [ex-actuator]) bid or placebo for 12 weeks. Weekly evaluations determined eligibility for prednisone dose reduction based on predetermined criteria.
The prednisone dose was significantly reduced by 47% and 63% in the groups receiving ciclesonide, 640 microg/d, and ciclesonide, 1,280 microg/d, respectively, vs an increase of 4% in the placebo group (both p < or = 0.0003) at week 12. By week 12, prednisone was discontinued by approximately 30% of patients in the ciclesonide-treated groups, vs 11% of patients in the placebo group (both p < or = 0.04). FEV1 improved significantly at week 12 in the ciclesonide treatment groups vs placebo (p < 0.03). The occurrence of local and systemic AEs was comparable between all treatment groups.
Study results suggest that ciclesonide significantly reduces the need for OCS in patients with severe, persistent asthma, while maintaining asthma control.
