Methotrexate pneumonitis in nonsurgical treatment of ectopic pregnancy.

We describe a case of pneumonitis following local administration of methotrexate for nonsurgical termination of an ectopic pregnancy. The signs and symptoms were similar to those seen with systemic use of the drug for other ailments. We believe that methotrexate represents a relatively effective alternative to surgery in patients with early unruptured tubal pregnancy, but suggest that it be used with caution in view of possible systemic toxicity.
