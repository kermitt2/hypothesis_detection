Ciprofloxacin-induced renal insufficiency in cystic fibrosis.

Acute renal insufficiency is known to occur in patients who are taking ciprofloxacin, particularly the elderly. We report two young patients with cystic fibrosis who presented with acute renal insufficiency after 2-3 weeks of oral ciprofloxacin therapy. The incidence of this adverse effect in children and young adults who have cystic fibrosis is unknown. Multiple mechanisms for ciprofloxacin-induced nephrotoxicity have been proposed.
