Significant drug interaction: phenytoin toxicity due to erlotinib.
Brain metastases are a frequent finding in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer and concomitant administration of antiepileptic and chemotherapeutic drugs or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor is necessary in many cases. Anticonvulsants have clinically significant interactions with other drugs used in brain tumor patients. We report a case in which a potential drug interaction resulted in elevated phenytoin levels after initiation of erlotinib therapy in a patient who was receiving phenytoin.
