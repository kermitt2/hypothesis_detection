Livedo reticularis associated with interferon alpha therapy in two melanoma patients.

We report two patients who developed intense livedo reticularis clearly related to the administration of interferon alpha 2b as an adjuvant therapy for melanoma. Histological studies showed scattered perivascular infiltrates without vasculitis. Laboratory tests excluded any underlying condition. Resolution of the symptoms was observed in both patients when interferon alpha was withdrawn. These cases highlight the occurrence of livedo reticularis as an uncommon side-effect of interferon alpha treatment.
