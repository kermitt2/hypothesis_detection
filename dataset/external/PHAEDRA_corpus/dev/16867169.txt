Inhibitory effects of cytostatically active 6-aminobenzo [c]phenanthridines on cytochrome P450 enzymes in human hepatic microsomes.


 Besides assays for the evaluation of efficacy new drug candidates have to undergo extensive testings for enhancement of pharmaceutical drug safety and optimization of application.
 The objective of the present work was to investigate the pharmacokinetic drug drug interaction potential for the cytostatically active 6-aminobenzo [c]phenanthridines BP-11 (6-amino-11,12-dihydro-11-(4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)benzo [c]phenanthridine) and BP-D7 (6-amino-11-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)benzo [c]phenanthridine) in vitro through incubation with human hepatic microsomes and marker substrates.
 For these studies the cytochrome P-450 isoenzymes and corresponding marker substrates recommended by the EMEA (The European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products) were chosen.
 In detail these selective substrates were caffeine (CYP1A2),coumarin (CYP2A6), tolbutamide (CYP2C9), S-(+)-mephenytoin (CYP2C19), dextromethorphane (CYP2D6), chlorzoxazone (CYP2E1) and testosterone (CYP3A4).
 Incubations with each substrate were carried out without a possible inhibitor and in the presence of a benzo [c]phenanthridine or a selective inhibitor at varying concentrations.
 Marker activities were determined by HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography).
     For the isoenzymes showing more than 50% inhibition by the addition of 20 microM BP-11 or BP-D7 additional concentrations of substrate and inhibitor were tested for a characterization of the inhibition.

     The studies showed a moderate risk for BP-11 for interactions with the cytochrome P-450 isoenzymes CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4.


     BP-D7, the compound with the highest cytotstatic efficacy, showed only a moderate risk for interactions with drugs, also metabolized by CYP3A4.
