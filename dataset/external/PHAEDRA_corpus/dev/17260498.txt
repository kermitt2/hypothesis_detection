Fatal interstitial pneumonitis associated with docetaxel administration in a patient with hormone-refractory prostate cancer.

Taxanes are widely used chemotherapeutic agents with the potential to induce pulmonary injury through a variety of mechanisms. Patients receiving these agents are at risk of acute or subacute pulmonary damage. The case is presented of a 72-year-old man with hormone-refractory prostate cancer and weekly administration of 30 mg/m2 docetaxel who developed subacute interstitial pneumonitis-related pulmonary fibrosis after seven doses and died despite mechanical ventilation and high-dose corticosteroid treatment. Even though only a few cases of this adverse event have been reported in the literature, severe docetaxel-induced pulmonary toxicity needs to be considered in the differential diagnosis when such patients present with respiratory symptoms.
