Severe leukopenia associated with mild hepatotoxicity in an HIV carrier treated with nevirapine.

Nevirapine is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor used in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients and in post-exposure prophylaxis. However, its use has recently been limited because of adverse cutaneous and hepatic effects. We report an HIV-infected woman who developed mild leukopenia as the first sign of a nevirapine-related adverse event, which was followed by skin and hepatic toxicity associated with a more severe leukopenia.
