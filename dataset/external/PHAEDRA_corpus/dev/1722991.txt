Usefulness of antiplatelet drugs in the management of heparin-associated thrombocytopenia and thrombosis.

Heparin-associated thrombocytopenia and thrombosis is a severe complication of systemic heparin therapy. Its treatment is mainly based upon discontinuation of heparin therapy. However in some patients requiring emergency cardiac or vascular surgery, reexposure to heparin may be unavoidable. We report the management of two such patients by use of antiplatelet drugs for a vascular procedure. In the two cases, a combination of iloprost, a stable prostacyclin analogue (1 to 2 ng/kg/mn) with aspirin and dipyridamole was shown to inhibit ex vivo the heparin-induced platelet aggregation. These antiplatelet agents were continued during the perioperative period. A successful vascular procedure was achieved with full heparinization without subsequent thrombocytopenia or thrombotic or hemorrhagic complications. This experience supports the hypothesis that heparin can be readministered early to patients with heparin-associated thrombocytopenia and thrombosis, provided antiplatelet therapy is given.
