Anaphylactic reaction and unrelated, subsequent, known side effects during therapy with thiethylperazine.
We report the first case presenting with successive anaphylactic reaction and extra-pyramidal syndrome after treatment with thiethylperazine maleate (thiethylperazine). Both reactions were caused due to this anti-emetic drug, but an additive effect of clemastine fumarate, prescribed to treat the anaphylactic reaction, is suggested by the sequence of events. We discuss the importance of knowing the pharmacological similitudes of common prescribed drugs in order to avoid the occurrence of side effects.
