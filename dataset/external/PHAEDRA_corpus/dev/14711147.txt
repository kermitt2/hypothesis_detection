Doxycycline-induced photo-onycholysis.

An uncommon manifestation of phototoxicity, photo-onycholysis results in the separation of the distal nail from the nail bed. Photo-onycholysis may follow the use of various medications or may occasionally be idiopathic. We present a case of photo-onycholysis in a patient treated with doxycycline for acne vulgaris.
