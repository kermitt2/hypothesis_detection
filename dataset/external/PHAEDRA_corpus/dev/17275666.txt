Juvenile absence epilepsy exacerbated by valproic acid.

Valproic acid is commonly and effectively used in the treatment of idiopathic generalized epilepsies, including juvenile absence epilepsy. Although several adverse effects are associated with this drug, it has only rarely been known to exacerbate seizures. Similar to antiarrhythmic drugs aggravating particular arrhythmias, antiepileptic drugs can paradoxically induce new seizure types or exacerbate existing ones. This reaction is better known with carbamazepine and phenytoin, but is less common with broad-spectrum antiepileptic drugs such as valproic acid. This report describes a case of paradoxical, intravenous valproic acid-induced seizure exacerbation in a child with juvenile absence epilepsy, documented by video-electroencephalography.
