Encephalopathy and seizures induced by intravesical alum irrigations.

Hemorrhagic cystitis is a significant toxic effect of cyclophosphamide therapy. Continuous bladder irrigation of a 1% alum solution is a simple and generally safe method of chemical cautery to treat the bleeding urothelium. We report four cases of encephalopathy coincident with elevated aluminum levels as well as one patient who developed seizures while receiving continuous bladder irrigations with alum. All patients had significant renal insufficiency. We recommend the cautious use of alum irrigation in patients with renal impairment and monitoring of serum aluminum levels to prevent excessive accumulation and toxicity.
