 Effect of efavirenz on the pharmacokinetics of ketoconazole in HIV-infected patients.


 To investigate the effect of efavirenz on the ketoconazole pharmacokinetics in HIV-infected patients.
 Twelve HIV-infected patients were assigned into a one-sequence, two-period pharmacokinetic interaction study.
 In phase one, the patients received 400 mg of ketoconazole as a single oral dose on day 1; in phase two, they received 600 mg of efavirenz once daily in combination with 150 mg of lamivudine and 30 or 40 mg of stavudine twice daily on days 2 to 16.
 On day 16, 400 mg of ketoconazole was added to the regimen as a single oral dose.
 Ketoconazole pharmacokinetics were studied on days 1 and 16.

     Pretreatment with efavirenz significantly increased the clearance of ketoconazole by 201%.

 C(max) and AUC(0-24) were significantly decreased by 44 and 72%, respectively.
 The T ((1/2)) was significantly shorter by 58%.
      
     Efavirenz has a strong inducing effect on the metabolism of ketoconazole.
