Intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide for persisting cystoid macular edema after penetrating keratoplasty.

PURPOSE: The intravitreal application of triamcinolone acetonide as treatment of long-standing, therapy-resistant cystoid macular edema after penetrating keratoplasty is reported.
METHODS: A 44-year-old patient showed therapy-resistant cystoid macular edema for 2 years after repeated penetrating keratoplasty was performed as treatment of keratoconus. The crystalline lens was clear. The patient received an intravitreal injection of approximately 20 mg of triamcinolone acetonide. Preinjection visual acuity measured 20/80.
RESULTS: Within the first 4 weeks after the injection, dense cataract developed necessitating cataract surgery. After phakoemulsification, visual acuity improved to 20/50. Optical coherent tomography and fluorescein angiography showed an almost complete resolution of cystoid macular edema. Ten months after the injection, visual acuity remained at 20/50, and intraocular pressure measured 15 mm Hg without antiglaucomatous therapy taken.
CONCLUSIONS: Intravitreal injection of triamcinolone acetonide may be an additional tool in the treatment of therapy-resistant cystoid macular edema after penetrating keratoplasty. After intravitreal injection of triamcinolone acetonide, cataract may rapidly develop in eyes that have been intensively treated, topically and systemically, by corticosteroids for several years.
