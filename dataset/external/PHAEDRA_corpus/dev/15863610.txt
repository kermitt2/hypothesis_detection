Malignant mixed mullerian tumor of the uterus in a patient taking raloxifene.

BACKGROUND: Uterine malignant mixed mesodermal tumor is a rare variant of uterine cancer. Data suggest that tamoxifen is involved in the pathogenesis. We report a case of a women in whom a malignant mixed mesodermal tumor was diagnosed while she was taking raloxifene, which is also a selective estrogen receptor modulator.
CASE: A malignant mixed mesodermal tumor was diagnosed in a 64-year-old woman with a bicornuate uterus while she was taking raloxifene for osteoporosis prevention. Diagnosis had been delayed secondary to sampling of the other uterine horn.
CONCLUSION: There may be an association between raloxifene and the development of malignant mixed mesodermal tumor. Special attention should be paid when attempting to sample the endometrium in patients with mullerian abnormalities.
