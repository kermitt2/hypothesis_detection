Fatal peripheral neuropathy following FLA chemotherapy.
We discuss a case with significant progressive peripheral neurological deterioration following administration of both fludarabine and cytarabine as part of the FLA (fludarabine and cytarabine) regime. Of particular interest is that toxicity only occurred during the second course of FLA and sixth course of Ara-C containing chemotherapy. At this point, a new antifungal agent had been commenced, suggesting a possible drug interaction enhancing the risk of known neurological toxicity with this regime.
