     Ciprofloxacin greatly increases concentrations and hypotensive effect of tizanidine by inhibiting its cytochrome P450 1A2-mediated presystemic metabolism.


 Tizanidine, a centrally acting skeletal muscle relaxant, is metabolized mainly by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2 and has a low oral bioavailability.
 The fluoroquinolone antibiotic ciprofloxacin is only a moderately potent inhibitor of CYP1A2.
 Our objective was to study the extent and mechanism of a possible interaction of ciprofloxacin with tizanidine.
 In a double-blind, randomized, 2-phase crossover study, 10 healthy volunteers ingested 500 mg ciprofloxacin or placebo twice daily for 3 days.
 On day 3, a single dose of 4 mg tizanidine was ingested 1 hour after the morning dose of ciprofloxacin.
 Plasma concentrations of tizanidine and ciprofloxacin and pharmacodynamic variables were measured.
 A caffeine test was used as a marker for CYP1A2 activity.

     Ciprofloxacin increased the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinity  [AUC(0-infinity)] of tizanidine by 10-fold (range, 6-fold to 24-fold; P < .001)and its peak concentration by 7-fold (range, 4-fold to 21-fold; P < .001), whereas its elimination half-life was only prolonged from 1.5 to 1.8 hours (P = .007).


     The pharmacodynamic effects of tizanidine were much stronger during the ciprofloxacin phase than during the placebo phase with regard to changes in systolic blood pressure (-35 mm Hg versus -15 mm Hg, P = .001), diastolic blood pressure (-24 mm Hg versus -11 mm Hg, P < .001), Digit Symbol Substitution Test (P = .02), subjective drug effect (P = .002), and subjective drowsiness (P = .009).

 The AUC(0-infinity) of tizanidine and its change correlated (P < .01) with the caffeine/paraxanthine ratio and its change.

     Ciprofloxacin greatly elevates plasma concentrations of tizanidine and dangerously potentiates its hypotensive and sedative effects, mainly by inhibiting its CYP1A2-mediated metabolism, at least when administered 1 hour before tizanidine.

 Tizanidine seems to be a useful probe drug for measuring presystemic metabolism by CYP1A2.
 Care should be exercised when tizanidine is used concomitantly with ciprofloxacin.
