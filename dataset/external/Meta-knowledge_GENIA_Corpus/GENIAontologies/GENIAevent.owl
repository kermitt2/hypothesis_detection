Definition: 
The selective, often stoichiometric interaction of a molecule with one or more specific sites on another molecule.
Comment: 
Note that ligand is being used in its broadest biological sense. For ligands that bind to signal transducing receptors, consider the molecular function term 'receptor binding ; GO\:0005102' and its children.

Definition
    The process by which genetic material undergoes a detectable and heritable structural change. There are three categories of mutation: genome mutations, involving addition or subtraction of one or more whole chromosomes; chromosome mutations, which alter the structure of chromosomes; and gene mutations, where the structure of a gene is altered at the molecular level.
