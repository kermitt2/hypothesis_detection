        <s sid="144">The ADPRT1 polymorphism evaluated in this study, located within the COOH-terminal catalytic domain, has been associated with the risk of thyroid carcinoma, carcinoma of gastric cardia and smoking-related lung cancer (<xref class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-46" rid="xref-ref-46-1">46</xref>,<xref class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-47" rid="xref-ref-47-1">47</xref>).<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Bac" conceptID="Bac35" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
        <s sid="145">A functional study had reported that the at-risk variant allele exhibited a 40% reduction in enzyme activity that resulted in a subsequent reduction in BER capacity.<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Bac" conceptID="Bac36" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
        <s sid="146">This reduction in capacity may lead to genome instability associated with the increased risk of tumor development (<xref class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-48" rid="xref-ref-48-1">48</xref>).<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Bac" conceptID="Bac37" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>

        <s sid="149">Most polymorphisms are located outside gene boundaries and thus thought not to have any apparent effects on protein functions.<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Bac" conceptID="Bac39" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
        <s sid="150">If a polymorphism is within the coding region of a gene, amino acid substitution may occur and result in change of protein activity, whereas polymorphisms in the promoter will alter the efficiency of transcription and polymorphisms located at an intron or exon boundary in a gene may produce incorrect messenger RNA splicing, which results in incomplete or inactive proteins.<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Bac" conceptID="Bac40" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
        <s sid="151">Thus, in this study, although no association of polymorphisms in APE1 Asp148Glu and MGMT1 Leu84Phe with risk of BD exposed was found, other polymorphisms in the promoter and coding region of these genes, yet to be identified, may contribute to risk of BD exposure.<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Mot" conceptID="Mot3" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>

        <s sid="152">In conclusion, our results reported that BD-exposed workers had higher frequencies of MN compared with controls, a result that indicates a pronounced clastogenicity of BD.<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Con" conceptID="Con7" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>

        <s sid="156">Particular attention should be paid to identify genetic markers as well as gene&#8211;gene and gene&#8211;environment interaction that may predict individual susceptibility to genetic damage.<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Mot" conceptID="Mot5" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
