        <s sid="76">We observed cancer deaths at expected levels for the entire cohort (168 observed, 170.4 expected), but observed deaths exceeded expected deaths only in the highest cumulative exposure group (26 observed, 19.9 expected), without evidence of a trend.<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Res" conceptID="Res26" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
        <s sid="77">Workers with chloracne had a 50% deficit for all cancers combined.<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Res" conceptID="Res27" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
        <s sid="78">Many studies of highly exposed dioxin workers and 8 of 12 NIOSH subcohorts report a small increase in risk for all malignant neoplasms combined, but no particular cancer site has been consistently prominent across studies.<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Bac" conceptID="Bac7" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
        <s sid="79">A causal relation of this nature would be very unusual in occupational studies since all known carcinogens precipitate one or more cancers of specific types.<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Bac" conceptID="Bac8" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
        <s sid="80">Some have suggested that dioxin may be a generalised carcinogenic agent which may act as a tumour promoter at multiple sites by increasing cell proliferation or inhibiting apoptosis.<xref class="xref-ref" href="#ref-24" rid="xref-ref-24-1">24</xref> This, however, does not explain the lack of specificity seen across cohorts.<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Bac" conceptID="Bac9" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
        <s sid="81">Others have proposed that confounding exposures could be producing the all cancer increased risk in the dioxin cohorts.<xref class="xref-ref" href="#ref-25" rid="xref-ref-25-1">25</xref> Given the wide range of site specific cancer risks among persons with high dioxin exposures, a single agent aetiology seems unlikely, and we favour the later hypothesis.<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Hyp" conceptID="Hyp1" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>

        <s sid="86">Our findings from the largest single study group in the NIOSH and IARC multi-plant studies also highlight the wide range of cancer rates across individual dioxin studies and the heterogeneity of findings within these multi-plant investigations.<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Con" conceptID="Con11" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
