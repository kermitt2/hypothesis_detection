        <s sid="11">Much controversy has surrounded the finding of an increased risk of endometrial cancer in post-menopausal women taking tamoxifen as an adjuvant therapy for breast cancer (<xref class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-1" rid="xref-ref-1-1">1</xref>&#8211;<xref class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-4" rid="xref-ref-4-1">4</xref>).<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Bac" conceptID="Bac2" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
        <s sid="12">The current explanation for this is that tamoxifen acts as an agonist of oestrogen action in the uterus, leading to hyperplasia of the endometrium, and thus promotes endogenous initiated cells to neoplasias, as with hormone replacement therapy (<xref class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-5" rid="xref-ref-5-1">5</xref>).<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Bac" conceptID="Bac3" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
        <s sid="13">This idea has been reinforced by numerous studies that have demonstrated thickening of the endometrium by ultrasonography during tamoxifen treatment, prior to the finding of polyps and adenocarcinomas of the endometrium (<xref class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-6" rid="xref-ref-6-1">6</xref>).<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Bac" conceptID="Bac4" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>

        <s sid="15">Endometrial adenocarcinomas associated with prolonged tamoxifen treatment have been attributed to a possible genotoxic effect of tamoxifen in the endometrium (<xref class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-9" rid="xref-ref-9-1">9</xref>,<xref class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-10" rid="xref-ref-10-1">10</xref>), although the evidence for this is not considered convincing (<xref class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-11" rid="xref-ref-11-1">11</xref>), because of the low level of DNA adducts that have been found in endometrial biopsies from women taking tamoxifen (<xref class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-9" rid="xref-ref-9-2">9</xref>,<xref class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-10" rid="xref-ref-10-2">10</xref>).<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Bac" conceptID="Bac6" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
        <s sid="16">The concept that tamoxifen could be genotoxic to women derives from the accumulation of DNA adducts in the livers of rats given tamoxifen that precedes the formation of liver cancers in as little as a year (<xref class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-12" rid="xref-ref-12-1">12</xref>&#8211;<xref class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-14" rid="xref-ref-14-1">14</xref>).<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Bac" conceptID="Bac7" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>

        <s sid="19">As the chemopreventative treatment period is likely to be longer than the treatment period for tamoxifen use in adjuvant therapy for breast cancer, the long-term safety of tamoxifen use becomes even more important for risk&#8211;benefit analysis of its chemopreventative use.<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Bac" conceptID="Bac10" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
