      <p xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="p-47">
        <s sid="149">The present analyses using whole liver revealed that FF continuously exerted increased fatty acid oxidation and DNA-damaging effects, such as elevation of 8-OHdG in liver DNA, and increased mRNA levels of DNA repair enzymes during the stage of tumor formation.<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Con" conceptID="Con4" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
        <s sid="150">In addition, decreased GST activity was observed with concomitant decrease in the expression of some GST subunits in the FF-treated groups.<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Res" conceptID="Res26" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
        <s sid="151">GST substrate, CDNB, has the broadest range of isozyme detectability (e.g., alpha-, mu-, pi-, and other GST isoforms).<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Bac" conceptID="Bac16" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
        <s sid="152">Therefore, it was considered that the GST activity in the present study was the value containing the activity of the isozyme assayed for by either of the genes assayed by mRNA levels.<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Con" conceptID="Con5" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
        <s sid="153">These findings suggest the possibility that the oxidative stress was induced continuously and decreased activities of its eliminating enzymes further perturb redox balances.<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Con" conceptID="Con6" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
        <s sid="154">Furthermore, under such circumstances, a significant increase in the number of HAF as well as the incidence and multiplicity of HCAs observed in the DEN-FF group compared with the DEN-alone group strongly suggest that FF has a liver tumor-promoting effect through the production of reactive oxygen species.<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Res" conceptID="Res27" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
        <s sid="155">On the other hand, a limited accumulation of lipofuscin, which is known as an indirect indicator of oxidative stress (<xref class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-29" rid="xref-ref-29-1">Reddy et al., 1982</xref>), was observed in hepatocellular proliferative lesions induced by FF, in contrast to excess lipofuscin accumulation in surrounding normal liver tissues.<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Res" conceptID="Res28" novelty="None" advantage="None"/><CoreSc2 atype="GSC" type="Bac" conceptID="Bac17" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>

        <s sid="160">Thus, in the present study, we focused on hepatocellular proliferative lesions consisting of GST-P&#8722;positive and GST-P&#8722;negative lesions and performed region-specific analyses using LMD and gene expression analyses and immunohistochemistry.<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Obj" conceptID="Obj4" novelty="None" advantage="None"/><CoreSc2 atype="GSC" type="Met" conceptID="Met26" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>

        <s sid="166">With respect to the DNA repair enzymes, mRNA analyses using LMD in liver tumors of mice induced by dicyclanil has demonstrated no remarkable upregulation of an oxidative DNA damage repair gene, such as Ogg1, combined with the negative regulation of apoptosis and the induction of oxidative stress (<xref class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-20" rid="xref-ref-20-1">Moto et al., 2006</xref>).<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Bac" conceptID="Bac20" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
        <s sid="167">This means that there is a high possibility of reduced DNA repair ability in these hepatocellular proliferative lesions compared with the normal surrounding areas.<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Hyp" conceptID="Hyp3" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
        <s sid="168">In contrast, in our study, the expressions of Apex1 and Xrcc5 in the hepatocellular proliferative lesions of the DEN-FF group were higher than those of GST-P&#8722;positive foci of the DEN-alone group.<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Res" conceptID="Res31" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>

        <s sid="170">These results may suggest the possibility that FF-induced hepatocellular proliferative lesions, including GST-P&#8722;positive and GST-P&#8722;negative lesions, still preserve DNA repairing ability during the stage of tumor formation.<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Con" conceptID="Con10" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
