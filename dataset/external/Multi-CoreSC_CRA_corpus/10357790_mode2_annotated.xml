        <s sid="14">Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the second most frequent cause of cancer death in women (<xref class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-1" rid="xref-ref-1-1">1</xref>).<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Bac" conceptID="Bac2" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
        <s sid="15">The American Cancer Society has estimated that there will be 178 700 new breast cancer cases and ~16% of all cancer related mortality (43 500 cancer related deaths) in 1998.<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Bac" conceptID="Bac3" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
        <s sid="16">Unlike the common non-hormone-dependent adult cancers, breast cancer is exceptional before the age of 20 years and is rare below 30 years but then the incidence rises very steadily up to the age of 50 years, after which the rate of increase slows down, although the incidence rate continues to rise.<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Bac" conceptID="Bac4" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
        <s sid="17">This shows that a relationship must exist between ovarian hormones and breast cancer, although it has not been clarified which specific hormones are involved in the breast carcinogenesis (<xref class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-2" rid="xref-ref-2-1">2</xref>).<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Hyp" conceptID="Hyp1" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>

      <p xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="p-3">
        <s sid="18">The epidemiological evidence provides strong support for this concept (<xref class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-3" rid="xref-ref-3-1">3</xref>).<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Bac" conceptID="Bac5" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
        <s sid="19">From among the various recognized risk factors, age of menarche, age of first pregnancy and age of menopause suggest that endogenous sex hormones may play the predominant role at all stages in the development of breast cancer (<xref class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-4" rid="xref-ref-4-1">4</xref>&#8211;<xref class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-9" rid="xref-ref-9-1">9</xref>).<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Bac" conceptID="Bac6" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
        <s sid="20">Because of their physiologic stimulatory actions on mammary gland, oestrogens, especially oestrone and oestradiol, have long been linked to the risk of breast cancer (<xref class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-10" rid="xref-ref-10-1">10</xref>).<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Bac" conceptID="Bac7" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
        <s sid="21">Epidemiological evidence derives from investigating the effects of exogenous oestrogens on the incidence of breast cancer, such as long-term use of oral contraceptive pills (<xref class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-11" rid="xref-ref-11-1">11</xref>) and oestrogen replacement therapy (<xref class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-12" rid="xref-ref-12-1">12</xref>), supports this linkage.<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Bac" conceptID="Bac8" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
        <s sid="22">Furthermore, animal studies have shown repeatedly that oestrogens are able to induce and promote mammary tumours, and removal of ovaries, or administration of anti-oestrogenic drugs, achieves the opposite effect (<xref class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-13" rid="xref-ref-13-1">13</xref>).<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Bac" conceptID="Bac9" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
        <s sid="23">However, the epidemiological evidence linking oestrogens with breast cancer risk is provocative but not conclusive for two reasons.<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Bac" conceptID="Bac10" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
        <s sid="24">Firstly, repeated full-term pregnancies at an early age, with the consequence of long-lasting increase of oestrogenic levels, are associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer.<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Bac" conceptID="Bac11" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
        <s sid="25">Secondly, the highest incidence of breast cancer is observed in old women when the oestrogenic level has been very low for decades (<xref class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-14" rid="xref-ref-14-1">14</xref>).<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Bac" conceptID="Bac12" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
      </p>
      <p xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="p-4">
        <s sid="26">Considerable efforts have been made in the past in attempting to show that women with high risk of breast cancer and/or those who subsequently develop the disease have abnormal endocrine profiles.<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Bac" conceptID="Bac13" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
        <s sid="27">However, comparative studies of high- and low-risk groups and familial studies have failed to yield consistent evidence that individuals' urinary and plasma oestrogen levels are associated with the increased risk (<xref class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-15" rid="xref-ref-15-1">15</xref>).<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Bac" conceptID="Bac14" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
        <s sid="28">Interestingly, the evidence for urinary and plasma steroids is stronger for androgens than for oestrogens in predicting breast cancer (<xref class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-16" rid="xref-ref-16-1">16</xref>).<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Bac" conceptID="Bac15" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
      </p>
      <p xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="p-5">
        <s sid="29">Based on these observations, androgens have also been proposed as a possible carcinogenic factor in breast cancer (<xref class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-3" rid="xref-ref-3-2">3</xref>).<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Bac" conceptID="Bac16" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
        <s sid="30">This proposal is mainly supported by the fact that the incidence of breast cancer is high in post-menopausal women when androgenic levels are high (<xref class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-17" rid="xref-ref-17-1">17</xref>).<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Bac" conceptID="Bac17" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
        <s sid="31">Furthermore, administration of androgens for cystic disease has been shown to increase the risk of breast cancer (<xref class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-18" rid="xref-ref-18-1">18</xref>).<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Bac" conceptID="Bac18" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
        <s sid="32">It has been reported that higher androgens and lower progesterone levels have been found in pre-menopausal women with breast cancer compared with controls (<xref class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-19" rid="xref-ref-19-1">19</xref>).<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Bac" conceptID="Bac19" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
        <s sid="33">Moreover, Japanese women, who have a lower risk of breast cancer than their American and British counterparts, have lower plasma androgen levels.<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Bac" conceptID="Bac20" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
        <s sid="34">More recently, a number of researchers have demonstrated that, among all plasma steroids, the evidence for association of testosterone levels with breast cancer is strongest, although they could not determine whether this association is a cause or an effect of malignancy (<xref class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-20" rid="xref-ref-20-1">20</xref>).<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Bac" conceptID="Bac21" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
      </p>
      <p xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="p-6">
        <s sid="35">However, although quite a few studies have evaluated plasma androgen levels in relation to breast cancer risk, the results have been inconsistent.<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Bac" conceptID="Bac22" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
        <s sid="36">Testosterone has been positively associated with breast cancer in most (<xref class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-21" rid="xref-ref-21-1">21</xref>&#8211;<xref class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-26" rid="xref-ref-26-1">26</xref>), but not all (<xref class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-27" rid="xref-ref-27-1">27</xref>,<xref class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-28" rid="xref-ref-28-1">28</xref>), previous studies.<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Bac" conceptID="Bac23" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
        <s sid="37">Furthermore, most studies suggested that increased levels of testosterone might have a modest but indirect association with breast cancer through its conversion to oestradiol (<xref class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-29" rid="xref-ref-29-1">29</xref>,<xref class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-30" rid="xref-ref-30-1">30</xref>).<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Bac" conceptID="Bac24" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>

      <p xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="p-7">
        <s sid="38">The uncertainty of the roles of sex hormones, especially androgens, in breast carcinogenesis is, at least in part, due to a lack of a suitable animal model to enable researchers to carry out detailed investigations.<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Mot" conceptID="Mot3" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
        <s sid="39">The two most widely used experimental systems for the study of mammary cancer involve the use of chemical carcinogens, such as 1,2-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene and N-methylnitrosourea.<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Met" conceptID="Met2" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
        <s sid="40">These rodent models are excellent to study the early events of chemical carcinogenesis, malignant progression, and for carrying out in vivo signal transduction studies towards some oncogene-mediated events, such as ras-mediated events (<xref class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-31" rid="xref-ref-31-1">31</xref>).<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Met" conceptID="Met3" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
        <s sid="41">However, these models, as well as other models induced by adenovirus and ionizing radiation, are not ideal for investigating mammary carcinogenesis, as they do not closely mimic the hormonal situation in normal animals.<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Met" conceptID="Met4" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>

      <p xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="p-8">
        <s sid="42">Noble and his colleagues had conducted pioneering studies on the induction of mammary cancer by steroid hormones in a rat strain (Noble) (<xref class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-32" rid="xref-ref-32-1">32</xref>).<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Bac" conceptID="Bac25" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
        <s sid="43">Because of their interests in prostate carcinogenesis, very little details about mammary carcinogenesis were given in the report.<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Bac" conceptID="Bac26" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
        <s sid="44">Furthermore, they used estrone, one of the most cytotoxic forms of oestrogen, which is present in high levels only in post-menopausal women.<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Bac" conceptID="Bac27" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
        <s sid="45">Key (<xref class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-33" rid="xref-ref-33-1">33</xref>) has reviewed the relationship of hormones and cancer in humans and suggested that sex hormones affect both early and late stages in breast carcinogenesis.<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Bac" conceptID="Bac28" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>

      <p xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="p-9">
        <s sid="47">We have developed a new animal model for mammary cancer based on Noble's method (<xref class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-32" rid="xref-ref-32-2">32</xref>), with an important modification, using a combination of testosterone and 17&#946;-oestradiol (E<sub>2</sub>), which more closely mimics breast cancer in human.<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Met" conceptID="Met5" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
        <s sid="48">Using this animal model, we have successfully induced the development of a high percentage of mammary cancer in female Noble rats.<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Res" conceptID="Res6" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
        <s sid="49">We have examined the expression of tumour growth factor-&#946; and vascular endothelial growth factor and their receptors in mammary cancer (<xref class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-34" rid="xref-ref-34-1">34</xref>&#8211;<xref class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-36" rid="xref-ref-36-1">36</xref>).<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Bac" conceptID="Bac29" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
        <s sid="50">We have established that an autocrine growth regulatory mechanism exists in this mammary cancer (B.Xie et al., submitted for publication).<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Bac" conceptID="Bac30" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
      </p>
      <p xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="p-10">
        <s sid="51">We have also carried out a comparative study to further investigate the role of sex hormones, especially testosterone, in mammary carcinogenesis.<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Goa" conceptID="Goa1" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
        <s sid="52">We found that prolonged treatment with a combination of oestradiol and testosterone induces much higher incidence of mammary cancer in Noble rats, than either hormone alone.<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Res" conceptID="Res7" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
        <s sid="53">The histopathological patterns of the induced tumours and the number of tumours per tumour-bearing animal very closely resemble human breast tumours.<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Res" conceptID="Res8" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
        <s sid="54">Furthermore, the dosage of testosterone, although it does not influence the cumulative tumour incidence, does affect the tumour latency period.<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Res" conceptID="Res9" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
