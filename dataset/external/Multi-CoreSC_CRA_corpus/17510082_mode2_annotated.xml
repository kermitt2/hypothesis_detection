        <s sid="208">Aspirin is rapidly hydrolyzed to salicylate and other salicylic metabolites both in vivo (<xref class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-58" rid="xref-ref-58-1">58</xref>) and in vitro (<xref class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-59" rid="xref-ref-59-1">59</xref>).<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Bac" conceptID="Bac77" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
        <s sid="209">The clinical relevance of our data is strengthened by the fact that these concentrations of aspirin correspond to salicylate levels measured in the plasma of human patients, as well as to the therapeutic concentrations used in the treatment of arthritis (<xref class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-60" rid="xref-ref-60-1">60</xref>).<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Bac" conceptID="Bac78" novelty="None" advantage="None"/><CoreSc2 atype="GSC" type="Res" conceptID="Res45" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
        <s sid="210">Comparisons between concentrations used on cell cultures and plasma levels, however, are somewhat artificial, because of the inability to accurately mimic in vivo metabolism and tissue concentration of aspirin in epithelial or tumor cells.<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Met" conceptID="Met13" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
        <s sid="211">In addition, the duration of drug exposure in cell culture is minimal when compared with long-term use for the reason of chemoprevention.<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Met" conceptID="Met14" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
        <s sid="212">In our study, the effects of aspirin on apoptosis and cell cycle were greatest when the cells were treated with a single dose of 5&#8211;10 mM aspirin for 48 h.<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Res" conceptID="Res46" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
        <s sid="213">A dose-dependent response in G<sub>1</sub> arrest was already visible at lower concentrations in HCT116 cells (1.25&#8211;2.5 mM).<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Res" conceptID="Res47" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
        <s sid="214">Therefore, although the concentrations of aspirin used in our study may seem rather high, they are within the range that has been used in culture previously (1&#8211;20 mM) (<xref class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-4" rid="xref-ref-4-2">4</xref>,<xref class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-5" rid="xref-ref-5-5">5</xref>,<xref class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-61" rid="xref-ref-61-1">61</xref>), and the effects observed may accurately reflect a biomechanism of repetitive dosing for long-term chemoprevention.<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Con" conceptID="Con28" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
