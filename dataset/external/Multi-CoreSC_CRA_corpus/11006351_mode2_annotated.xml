        <s sid="22">Nevertheless, styrene was classified as a Type 2B carcinogen, i.e., a possible human carcinogen, because it is extensively metabolized in human and animal tissues to the genotoxic metabolite styrene-7,8-oxide (SO) (<xref class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-13" rid="xref-ref-13-1">IARC, 1994a</xref>,<xref class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-14" rid="xref-ref-14-1">IARC, 1994b</xref>).<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Bac" conceptID="Bac6" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>

        <s sid="26">As depicted in Figure 1, important routes of detoxification of SO are glutathione conjugation, eventually leading to the urinary excretion of the corresponding mercapturic acids, and epoxide hydrolysis, eventually leading to the urinary excretion of mandelic, phenylglyoxylic, and hippuric acid.<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Bac" conceptID="Bac10" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>

        <s sid="31">Nevertheless, the highly focal localization of these enzymes to only a few of the many cell types within the lung predisposes these cells to a disproportionate susceptibility to chemicals that undergo metabolic activation.<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Bac" conceptID="Bac14" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
        <s sid="32">This may also apply to styrene, as metabolic activation to SO has often been considered to be responsible for its carcinogenic effects (<xref class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-21" rid="xref-ref-21-1">Phillips and Farmer, 1994</xref>).<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Bac" conceptID="Bac15" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>

        <s sid="38">The most striking difference is the low proportion of agranular endoplasmatic reticulum, which accounts for 55 &#177; 8% and 66 &#177; 10% of the cellular components in mouse and rat Clara cells, but for only 3.1 &#177; 3.5% in human nonciliated bronchiolar epithelial cells (<xref class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-22" rid="xref-ref-22-2">Pinkerton et al., 1997</xref>).<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Bac" conceptID="Bac21" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
