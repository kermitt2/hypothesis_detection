        <s sid="25">One of these acid-catalyzed condensation products is indolo[3,2-b]carbazole (ICZ), which has several biological and structural characteristics in common with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD).<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Obj" conceptID="Obj3" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>

        <s sid="29">Gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) is generally lowered during the carcinogenic process, as documented by numerous investigations showing that connexin expression and GJIC is limited in tumors, and that tumor promoters inhibit GJIC.<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Bac" conceptID="Bac13" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
        <s sid="30">In vitro assays for GJIC show ~60% sensitivity for detecting known in vivo tumor promoters/epigenetic carcinogens (<xref class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-13" rid="xref-ref-13-1">13</xref>), and many cell-growth inhibitors, cancer chemopreventive agents, anti-oncogenes and differentiation agents enhance GJIC (<xref class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-14" rid="xref-ref-14-1">14</xref>).<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Bac" conceptID="Bac14" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>

        <s sid="32">In WB-F344 cells or C3H/10T1/2 mouse fibroblasts, TCDD does not inhibit GJIC (<xref class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-15" rid="xref-ref-15-1">15</xref>,<xref class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-16" rid="xref-ref-16-1">16</xref>), whereas TCDD reduces GJIC in primary rat hepatocytes and mouse hepatoma cells (Hepa1c1c7) (<xref class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-17" rid="xref-ref-17-1">17</xref>,<xref class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-18" rid="xref-ref-18-1">18</xref>).<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Bac" conceptID="Bac16" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
        <s sid="33">It has therefore been proposed that the AhR activation is needed for TCDD to induce down-regulation of GJIC and that TCCD specifically causes a transcriptional down-regulation or reduced stability of the mRNA encoding for the gap junction protein connexin 32 (Cx32) (<xref class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-17" rid="xref-ref-17-2">17</xref>).<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Hyp" conceptID="Hyp3" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>

        <s sid="150">An almost complete blockage of GJIC was observed after 24 h of treatment with either 1 &#956;M ICZ or 1 nM TCDD, although it was a slower inhibition than observed for another CYP inducer, phenobarbital (2 h), in mouse hepatocytes (<xref class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-20" rid="xref-ref-20-2">20</xref>).<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Bac" conceptID="Bac30" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
        <s sid="151">The more slowly occurring effects of TCDD and ICZ indicate that some other cellular events such as transcription of certain genes must take place before the ICZ-induced down-regulation of GJIC occurs.<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Bac" conceptID="Bac31" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>

        <s sid="155">In the present study, the TCDD-induced GJIC down-regulation was sustained longer than the ICZ-induced GJIC down-regulation, which may be caused by a faster removal of ICZ than TCDD.<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Res" conceptID="Res35" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>

        <s sid="156">It has been suggested that TCDD only inhibits GJIC in cells expressing functional AhR (<xref class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-17" rid="xref-ref-17-4">17</xref>,<xref class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-18" rid="xref-ref-18-3">18</xref>).<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Hyp" conceptID="Hyp4" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
        <s sid="157">Beside a direct regulation by the activated AhR, it has also been shown that down-stream cellular effects of AhR activation are involved in inhibition of GJIC [e.g. Cyp inhibitors, antioxidants (<xref class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-39" rid="xref-ref-39-1">39</xref>,<xref class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-40" rid="xref-ref-40-1">40</xref>), cAMP (<xref class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-17" rid="xref-ref-17-5">17</xref>) and protein kinase inhibitors (<xref class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-39" rid="xref-ref-39-2">39</xref>)].<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Bac" conceptID="Bac35" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>

        <s sid="159">Therefore, the immediate increase in EROD activity, and in Cyp1a1, Cyp1a2 and Cyp1b1 mRNA levels, and down-regulation after removal of ICZ, which correlated well with the inhibition of GJIC, indicates that AhR activation and/or Cyp activities are involved in the observed inhibition of GJIC.<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Res" conceptID="Res36" novelty="None" advantage="None"/><CoreSc2 atype="GSC" type="Con" conceptID="Con4" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
        <s sid="160">Preliminary studies performed in our laboratory using the Cyp1a inhibitors (SKF-525A and &#945;-naphthoflavone) indicate a direct role of the Cyp1a activity on the down-regulation of GJIC.<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Res" conceptID="Res37" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>

        <s sid="162">In the present experiments, the WB-F344 cells alone had no induction of Cyp1a1 mRNA or EROD, indicating that these cells do not show Ah-receptor activity, as found by one other group (<xref class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-41" rid="xref-ref-41-1">41</xref>).<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Res" conceptID="Res39" novelty="None" advantage="None"/><CoreSc2 atype="GSC" type="Con" conceptID="Con5" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>

        <s sid="164">Exposures to ICZ or TCDD lowered the Cx32 staining and GJIC, and the re-establishment of GJIC correlated well with the reappearance of Cx32 immunostaining at the cell&#8211;cell interface.<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Res" conceptID="Res41" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>

        <s sid="167">This indicates that the initial inhibition of GJIC is at least partly caused by a down-regulation of the transcription of Cx32, but it is not possible to exclude any inhibitory effects directly on the functional Cx32.<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Con" conceptID="Con6" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
        <s sid="168">The continuously low level of Cx32 mRNA throughout the experiment, also when GJIC and the Cx32 plaques are partly recovered, point out a second mechanism of regulation at post-transcriptional level.<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Res" conceptID="Res44" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>

        <s sid="173">In conclusion, the results presented in this report demonstrate that ICZ inhibits GJIC in rat primary hepatocytes by preventing the synthesis and/or the fusion of Cx32 proteins with the cell membrane.<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Con" conceptID="Con8" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
