        <s sid="204">Suppression of 8-OHdG formation and apoptosis in background normal-appearing liver parenchyma, cell proliferation in the areas of hepatic foci, and alterations in the expression of genes related to control of cell proliferation, might explain in part the hormetic inhibition of hepatocarcinogenesis by PB at low dose.<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Con" conceptID="Con17" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
