      <s sid="4">We show that nimesulide when administered orally, simultaneously with DSS at 5 mg/kg/day, not only totally prevents 8-oxodGuo formation but also suppresses the 5-fold increase of superoxide induced by DSS in the colonic mucosa.<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Res" conceptID="Res1" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
