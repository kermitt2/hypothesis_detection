        <s sid="228">It has been proposed that the metabolism of trichloroethylene to S-(1,2-dichlorovinyl)-<span class="sc">l</span>-cysteine is involved in its carcinogenic activity in the kidney (<xref class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-51" rid="xref-ref-51-1">51</xref>,<xref class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-52" rid="xref-ref-52-1">52</xref>).<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Bac" conceptID="Bac46" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
        <s sid="229">However, the promotion of kidney tumors by TCA and possibly by DCA would suggest that they too could contribute to the carcinogenic activity of trichloroethylene in the kidney.<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Con" conceptID="Con10" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>

        <s sid="230">In summary, the ability of chloroform, DCA and TCA to hypomethylate and increase the mRNA expression of the c-myc gene in the liver correlated with their ability to promote liver tumors.<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Con" conceptID="Con11" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
        <s sid="231">Furthermore, the prevention by chloroform of DCA but not TCA-induced hypomethylation and increased expression of the gene correlated with its prevention of only DCA-promotion of liver tumors.<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Res" conceptID="Res74" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
        <s sid="232">Hence, our results are consistent with hypomethylation and increased expression of c-myc gene being involved in the promotion of liver tumors by DCA and TCA.<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Con" conceptID="Con12" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
        <s sid="233">Furthermore, our results indicate that TCA as well as DCA when chloroform is co-administered can promote kidney tumors in male mice.<CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Res" conceptID="Res75" novelty="None" advantage="None"/></s>
