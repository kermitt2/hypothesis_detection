Capecitabine (CAP) is a pro-drug of 5-FU and peripheral neuropathy associated with CAP has not been reported. During analysis of 28 patients receiving CAP with concomitant radiation (XRT) for pancreatic cancer (resected or locally advanced), two patients developed signs and symptoms consistent with peripheral neuropathy. Patients received CAP 1200-1600 mg/m2 in two divided doses with XRT (total 5040-5400 Gy) x 6 weeks, followed by 4 weeks rest, then 6 cycles of CAP 2000-2500 mg/m2 in two divided doses x 14 days every (q) 3 weeks. Patients were assessed weekly during CAP-XRT and q 3 weeks during CAP alone. Patient A reported right leg weakness (foot drop) during week 4 of CAP-XRT (1600 mg/m2). Patient B developed perioral and upper extremity paresthesias during the fourth cycle of CAP alone (2500 mg/m2). Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) activity was measured by radioisotopic assay using lysates of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Neurologic examination revealed right foot drop in Patient A and was unremarkable in Patient B. Central nervous system imaging was negative. Electromyogram and nerve conduction studies showed sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy in both patients. DPD activity was normal in both patients. There was no evidence of disease progression. Neurologic symptoms resolved after stopping CAP for 4 weeks in Patient A, with no recurrence after reinitiating CAP alone at 2000 mg/m2. Patient B continued at 80% of standard dose (2000 mg/m2) and symptoms resolved without further intervention. We conclude peripheral neuropathy with 5-FU is rare. Neurotoxicity occurs most often with intermittent high dose 5-FU as bolus injection or 24- to 48-h infusions. The etiology of neurotoxicity in our two patients remains unclear; however, as CAP is rapidly metabolized to 5-FU in patients with normal liver function, it is likely that 5-FU or its active metabolites (fluoro-beta-alanine) were contributing factors. Knowledge regarding potential adverse effects of CAP is paramount and dose modification is indicated with development of neurotoxicity.",

Blood and urine samples were collected over a 98 h period for monitoring the efficacy and adequacy of FAB treatment. DGTX concentrations were determined after protein precipitation (release of FAB-bound and protein-bound DGTX) in unprocessed serum and urine samples, and after aliquots of these samples had been dialysed in vitro against DGTX-free buffer (elimination of DGTX not bound to FAB). The difference in DGTX concentration between the unprocessed and dialysed samples was the amount of DGTX bound to plasma proteins and the small fraction of unbound DGTX being relevant for the therapeutic and toxic effects of the drug. Before FAB therapy was started, the total serum DGTX concentration was 535 nmol/l. The first FAB infusion (320 mg) was started 11 h after drug ingestion. Since this amount of FAB was insufficient to bind all DGTX present in the serum, cardiac DGTX toxicity (total AV-block) persisted. During a second FAB infusion (400 mg) the patient reverted to regular AV-conduction. At this time most of the DGTX in serum was FAB-bound. Toxic symptoms (sinus arrest) reappeared twice and were accompanied by increasing amounts of non-antibody-bound DGTX in the serum. Additional application of FAB (2 x 80 mg) resulted in the immediate disappearance of arrhythmia. During FAB-treatment total DGTX serum concentrations and renal DGTX clearance rose, indicating redistribution of drug from tissue to serum and urinary elimination of FAB-bound DGTX, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Five days after the fourth dose of vincristine, she presented with bilateral ptosis. Neurological examination revealed bilateral ptosis, and complete external opthalmoplegia with normal pupillary and corneal reflexes. She received 3.8 mg cumulative dose of vincristin before development of ptosis. A neuroprotective and neuroregenerative treatment attempt with pyridoxine and pyridostigmine was initiated. The bilateral ptosis markedly improved after 7 days of pyridoxine and pyridostigmine treatment and completely resolved after two weeks. The both agents were given for 3 weeks and were well tolerated without any side effects. During the follow up period we did not observe residue or recurrence of the ptosis.",

His warfarin dosage was reduced and his INR stabilized. The fluvastatin was switched back to atorvastatin, and the warfarin dosage was increased to maintain the patient's goal INR. The literature supports a drug interaction between warfarin and fluvastatin due to the strong affinity of fluvastatin for the cytochrome P450 enzyme 2D6. This interaction has not been seen with atorvastatin. Lovastatin also reportedly has caused increases in INR when coadministered with warfarin. It is unclear whether simvastatin interacts with warfarin, but it may increase INRs slightly or increase serum simvastatin levels. One case report describes an interaction between simvastatin and the anticoagulant acenocoumarol, which resulted in an elevated INR. Pravastatin does not appear to interact with warfarin but has caused an increased INR when combined with the anticoagulant fluindione.

The combination therapy of interferon alpha and ribavirin was given to a 50-year-old female with CHC who had not responded to a previous treatment by interferon alpha. She has been admitted with non-productive cough, dyspnoea and fever 11 months after the initiation of combination therapy. Chest x-ray and thorax computed tomography revealed bilateral hilar masses and nodular infiltrations in the lung parenchyma. Pulmonary function test showed a mild restriction. Biopsy of mediastinal lymphadenopathy revealed noncaseating granuloma. She was diagnosed to have pulmonary sarcoidosis at stage II, and the combination treatment was discontinued. Her symptoms regressed after inhaler steroid treatment. Six months after the diagnosis of sarcoidosis, the patient was asymptomatic and a complete sustained response to hepatitis C was achieved.

Rhabdomyolysis can occur with all statins when used alone and particularly when combined with other drugs that are themselves myotoxic or that elevate the concentration of the statin.

Many confounding variables existed in each of these cases, such as hepatic dysfunction, poor appetite, and concomitant drugs that resulted in an increased anticoagulant response. We report a case that involved only one potential confounding variable. Continued documentation of azithromycin-warfarin interactions is valuable considering no mention of this drug interaction exists in most tertiary references and in the package insert for azithromycin, the demonstration that no drug interaction occurred in a retrospective review of 52 cases, and the widespread use of azithromycin in the community.

AIM AND BACKGROUND: The pharmacokinetic interaction between sirolimus, a macrolide immunosuppressant metabolized by CYP3A4, and the calcium channel blocker diltiazem was studied in 18 healthy subjects. Several clinically important interactions have previously been reported for other immunosuppressive drugs that are metabolized by the same enzyme and for calcium antagonists. METHODS: Healthy subjects who were 20 to 43 years old participated in an open, three-period, randomized, crossover study of the pharmacokinetics of a single 10-mg oral dose of sirolimus, a single oral 120-mg dose of diltiazem, and the two drugs given together. The three study periods were separated by a 21-day washout phase. RESULTS: The geometric mean (90% confidence interval) whole blood sirolimus area under the plasma concentration time-curve increased 60% (35%-90%), from 736 to 1178 ng x h/mL, and maximum concentration increased 43% (14%-81%), from 67 to 96 ng/mL, with diltiazem coadministration, whereas the mean elimination half-life of sirolimus decreased slightly, from 79 to 67 hours. Apparent oral clearance and volume of distribution of sirolimus decreased with 38% and 45%, respectively, when sirolimus was given with diltiazem. The plasma maximum concentration and area under the plasma concentration-time curve of diltiazem, desacetyldiltiazem, and desmethyldiltiazem were unchanged after coadministration of sirolimus, and no potentiation of the effects of diltiazem on diastolic or systolic blood pressure or on the electrocardiographic parameters was seen. CONCLUSIONS: Single-dose diltiazem coadministration leads to higher sirolimus exposure, presumably by inhibition of the first-pass metabolism of sirolimus. Because of the pronounced intersubject variability in the extent of the sirolimus-diltiazem interaction, whole blood sirolimus concentrations should be monitored closely in patients treated with the two drugs.",

The likelihood of requiring a platelet transfusion in rhIL-11-treated patients receiving chemotherapy is approximately 40% lower than the risk for untreated patients. Treatment with rhIL-11 appears to accelerate earlier recovery to platelet counts of 20,000/microL, 50,000/microL, and 100,000/microL, suggesting that patients treated with rhIL-11 are more likely to be able to receive their next chemotherapy cycle in a timely fashion. rhIL-11 shows sustained efficacy over multiple cycles of full-dose chemotherapy. Activity has also been demonstrated in pediatric patients with solid tumors. The use of rhIL-11 in combination with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF, filgrastim [Neupogen]) may also produce a synergistic hematopoietic effect, resulting in earlier neutrophil recovery. The recommended adult dose regimen for rhIL-11 is 50 micrograms/kg administered subcutaneously once daily beginning 6 to 24 hours after the administration of chemotherapy until a postnadir platelet count of > or = 50,000/microL is reached. The recommended pediatric dose of rhIL-11 is 75 micrograms/kg subcutaneously, once daily beginning 6 to 24 hours after the administration of chemotherapy until a postnadir platelet count of > or = 50,000/microL is reached. The administration of rhIL-11 for greater than 21 days has not been studied and therefore is not recommended.",

During treatment, an increase in international normalized ratio (INR) and her admission that she was taking a variety of natural products, to include boldo and fenugreek, led us to suspect that some of these natural products could alter the effect of warfarin. When she stopped the culpable products, the INR returned to normal after 1 week. The herb-drug interaction was observed a second time after both products were reintroduced a few days later. The imputability of this interaction to both natural products, as determined by the Naranjo algorithm, suggests a probable association between boldo-fenugreek and increased bleeding time in patients treated with warfarin. No undesirable reaction was reported during telephone discussions with the patient. Nevertheless, we recommend that clinicians treating patients with anticoagulant therapy be vigilant when patients also take herbal agents.",

Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a growing problem not only in the United States but also across the world. There is now strong evidence that intensive control of blood glucose can significantly reduce and retard the microvascular complications of retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy. Ultimately however, up to 80% of type 2 diabetics die from macrovascular cardiovascular disease. This increased incidence of atherosclerotic disease is intricately associated with insulin resistance, which is a major pathophysiologic abnormality in type 2 diabetes. There is strong evidence that insulin resistance is involved in the development of not only hyperglycemia, but also dyslipidemia, hypertension, hypercoagulation, vasculopathy, and ultimately atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. This cluster of metabolic abnormalities has been termed the insulin resistance or cardiovascular dysmetabolic syndrome. The thiazolidinediones (rosiglitazone and pioglitazone), a new class of oral antidiabetic agents, are \"insulin sensitizers\" and exert direct effects on the mechanisms of insulin resistance. These effects not only improve insulin sensitivity and glycemic control with reduced insulin requirements, but also have potentially favorable effects on other components of the cardiovascular dysmetabolic syndrome.

AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: There is evidence that insulin and glucose cause renal and ocular vasodilation. There is, however, currently no data on the effect of combined hyperglycaemia and hyperinsulinaemia on the renal and ocular blood flow seen in diabetic patients on insulin therapy. METHODS: We carried out two different 3-way crossover studies in healthy subjects (each, n = 9). In study one, hyperglycaemic clamps (5.6 mmol/l, 11.1 mmol/ 1, 16.7 mmol/l) were carried out during placebo or insulin (dose 1: 1 mU/kg/min; dose 2: 2 mU/kg/min) infusion. The second study was identical but endogenous insulin secretion was blocked with somatostatin. The renal plasma flow, glomerular filtration rate and pulsatile choroidal blood flow were measured using the paraaminohippurate method, the inulin method and a laser interferometric measurement of fundus pulsation amplitude, respectively. RESULTS: Insulin increased renal plasma flow and fundus pulsation amplitude but not the glomerular filtration rate. Hyperglycaemia increased all the renal and ocular parameters studied. Haemodynamic effects of glucose and insulin were additive when somatostatin was co-administered but not under basal conditions. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Glucose and insulin can exert additive vasodilator properties on renal and ocular circulation. To find out whether this observation is related to the increased regional perfusion in diabetes longitudinal studies on patients with Type I (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus are needed.",

DT-PACE (dexamethasone/thalidomide/cisplatin/doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide/etoposide) was offered to patients with preceding standard dose therapy, but no prior autotransplantation, while DCEP-T (dexamethasone/cyclophosphamide/etoposide/cisplatin/thalidomide) was administered for relapse after transplantation. If there were signs or symptoms suggestive of DVT, patients received additional investigations, including Doppler ultrasonography, followed by venography if indicated. Only patients on DT-PACE but not DCEP-T experienced an increased incidence of DVT. A statistical association between the incidence of DVT and combination chemotherapy including doxorubicin (P =.02) was observed; this association was confirmed on multivariate analysis. MM patients treated with thalidomide and doxorubicin have a high risk of developing DVT.",

Mice from the 20th generation of three lines divergently selected for response to pentobarbital-induced sedation times [long-sedation time (LST), short sedation time (SST), and randomly bred control (RBC)] were used to study cocaine-induced behavioral sensitization. These lines showed variable degrees of locomotor activities in response to cocaine. At a low cocaine dose and long withdrawal period (10 mg/kg, twice a day for 5 days followed by a 14-day withdrawal), the LST mice showed tolerance development. In response to cocaine, the locomotor activities of the SST were not significantly different from the RBC group. At a higher dose and a shorter withdrawal period (20 mg/kg, daily for 7 days followed by a 3-day withdrawal), the SST mice showed behavioral sensitization similar to the RBC mice, but the LST mice did not develop sensitization. The different responses in locomotor activity induced by cocaine suggest that genetic factors may play a role in determining the magnitude of response to this drug. Dopamine (DA) levels did not differ significantly in either striatum (STR) or nucleus accumbens (NAC) for the cocaine-treated animals to their corresponding saline-treated controls. The affinity (Kd) of D2 in the NAC decreased significantly, without changes in density (Bmax), in the cocaine-treated SST and RBC mice. On the other hand, the density of D2 binding sites in the SST and the RBC mice in the STR was significantly increased in cocaine-treated groups without change in Kd. The LST mice did not show any changes in the Kd and Bmax in either the STR or the NAC. Taken together, these findings suggest that the changes in the Kd of D2 in the NAC and the Bmax of D2 in the STR may contribute to the differences in locomotor responses to cocaine exposure in these mouse lines.",

An apparent link is described between the use of MMF with prednisone to treat pemphigus vulgaris and the development of red blood cell anemia. Specifically, after initiation of 500 mg MMF twice a day given in conjunction with the long-standing use of prednisone, which had been tapered to a dose of 10 mg daily, the patient's red blood cell count dropped by 17% over 7 weeks. To put this into perspective, total aplasia of red blood cells for 40 days would result in a drop of 30-33% in the red blood cell count. In the transplantation literature, MMF has been noted to lower red blood cell counts. One previous study of four transplant patients whose immediate post-transplantation immunosuppression utilized corticosteroids, cyclosporine, MMF, and anti-T-lymphocyte globulin noted anemia in 13% of them. The dermatology literature heretofore has not noted that anemia is a side effect of patients taking MMF to treat pemphigus. This report suggests that anemia can occur due to MMF, in particular when it is given with prednisone, a side effect well documented in the transplantation literature when the triple combination of MMF, cyclosporine and prednisone is used. It would therefore seem prudent to monitor red and white blood cell counts in patients taking MMF. A review of the literature also reveals that MMF is a safe medication that appears to have a more favorable side effect profile than azathioprine, although it is more expensive than azathioprine.",

However, many are already taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) that can have antihaemostatic effects. We assessed the bleeding risk in patients treated with thromboprophylactic dabigatran etexilate, with and without concomitant NSAID or ASA. A post-hoc analysis was undertaken of the pooled data from trials comparing dabigatran etexilate (220 mg and 150 mg once daily) and enoxaparin. Major bleeding event (MBE) rates were determined and odds ratios (ORs) generated for patients who received study treatment plus NSAID (half-life \u226412 hours) or ASA (\u2264160 mg/day) versus study treatment alone. Relative risks were calculated for comparisons between treatments. Overall, 4,405/8,135 patients (54.1%) received concomitant NSAID and 386/8,135 (4.7%) received ASA.ORs for the comparison with/without concomitant NSAID were 1.05 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.55-2.01) for 220 mg dabigatran etexilate; 1.19 (0.55-2.55) for 150 mg; and 1.32 (0.67-2.57) for enoxaparin. ORs for the comparison with/without ASA were 1.14 (0.26-5.03); 1.64 (0.36-7.49); and 2.57 (0.83-7.94), respectively. For both NSAIDs and ASA there was no significant difference in bleeding between patients with and without concomitant therapy in any treatment arm. Patients concomitantly taking NSAIDs or ASA have a similar risk of MBE to those taking dabigatran etexilate alone. No significant differences in MBE were detected between dabigatran etexilate and enoxaparin within co-medication subgroups, suggesting that no increased major bleeding risk exists when dabigatran etexilate is administered with NSAID or ASA.",

Systemic cyclosporin (10 mg/kg/day) resulted in resolution of the corneal ulceration within two weeks of beginning treatment, and the patient has remained in remission after 15 months of therapy. Cyclosporin side effects included hirsutism, hypertension, increased blood levels of urea and creatinine, and abnormalities in liver function tests. All these resolved on reducing the dosage of cyclosporin. The results in this case suggest that cyclosporin is an effective agent in patients with severe sight threatening Mooren's ulcer.",

Peripheral blood count revealed pancytopenia and a bone marrow biopsy was consistent with aplasia. Blood counts returned to normal 6 days after institution of granulocyte colony stimulating factor therapy. In the absence of mucositis or diarrhea, severe dermatologic toxicity following a single low dose of the drug suggests an 'allergic' or acute hypersensitivity reaction to MTX in this patient.

Each time he arrived at the anticoagulation clinic after his BCG therapy, his INR was supratherapeutic, except after his fourth treatment (INR of 2.5), which can be explained by residual effects from the phytonadione he received a week earlier. After completion of his BCG therapy, he was instructed to resume his usual warfarin sodium dosage of 19 mg weekly, and his INR remained in the desired therapeutic range. According to the Drug Interaction Probability Scale, the development of supratherapeutic INRs was probably associated with concomitant acetaminophen and moxifloxacin use.",

Thirty-six patients with AL received, in a three-month period, 51 cycles of combined chemotherapy which included, in all of them, cytosine arabinoside (ARA-C); among them, along with myelosuppression, five experienced fever, infectious complications, gastrointestinal tract symptoms and severe myalgias. Serum creatine kinase (CK), liver function tests and a light microscopy muscle biopsy were performed on all of them. Ten-17 days after receiving chemotherapy, five patients (4 males and 1 female) with acute lymphoblastic leukemia developed incapacitating myalgias in neck, thighs and arms. CK and/or alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase were increased 5-24 times above the normal range in four of these patients, and the muscle biopsy showed focal RML in all five. Myalgias were self-limited and lasted 4-10 days. In addition to the chemotherapy, other factors known to be capable of producing RML, such as sepsis, other medications, and dehydration were found. In conclusion, myalgias were due to focal RML produced probably by a combination of factors, particularly the chemotherapy along with dehydration due to gastrointestinal complications, infection, and the use of diverse antibiotics. The endemic nature of the finding in such a short period of time is outstanding.",

Between 1988 and 1993, more than 7,000 patients were diagnosed and treated. Since 1988, it has been noted that incidence of melarsoprol reaction had increased systematically between June and October of each year, indicating strong seasonal variation. In 1992 and 1993, two outbreaks of arsenical reactive encephalopathy (ARE) occurred in the sleeping sickness center of Adjumani. The incidence of ARE suddenly exceeded 10% of the patients treated by melarsoprol during August 1992 and September 1993. The onset of 80% of those \"epidemic\" cases, occurred between the 5th and the 11th day of treatment. Two retrospective studies were conducted in 1992 (75 cases) and in 1993 (51 cases). Among the risk factors studied, two appear to increase the risk of ARE: the prescription of thiabendazole to treat strongyloidiasis during the melarsoprol cure and the bad general clinical conditions of patients. These observations suggest that exogenous co-factors could be involved in the occurrence of ARE. Recommendations were to avoid administration of diffusible anti-helminthic treatment during the cure, and to improve the general conditions of patients before the cure of melarsoprol.",

He had been commenced on a course of fusidic acid at discharge in addition to his ongoing statin prescription and presented 4 weeks later with symptoms consistent with rhabdomyolysis. Severe rhabdomyolysis was confirmed and despite prolonged and complicated critical care management, his treatment was unsuccessful. Extensive investigations ruled out other known causes of this clinical presentation and failed to identify any other precipitating cause of rhabdomyolysis. We believe the most likely cause was hepatic inhibition of the CYP3A4 hepatic isoenzyme by fusidic acid resulting in an acute severe rise in plasma simvastatin level and extensive myocellular damage. Increasing MRSA colonisation and infection rates together with increased statin usage have the potential to increase the incidence of this presumed drug interaction.",

Alkaline hyperhydration, folinic acid and carboxypeptidase G2 were given. Prescription analyses by pharmacists and literature research have permitted us to suggest that a drug-drug interaction between methotrexate and proton pump inhibitors (PPI) was responsible for this renal failure. Several mechanisms of interaction were suggested and might be related to the inhibition of renal methotrexate transporters by PPI, an increase in the methotrexate efflux to the blood by an upregulation of multidrug resistance protein 3 by PPI or genetic polymorphisms. This case shows that pharmacists can help physicians to optimize patient treatment: they consensually decided on the systematic discontinuation of PPI or a switch to ranitidine when patients were treated by high-dose methotrexate.",

Though serotonin syndrome is most often associated with ingestion of more than one serotonergic drug, many other mechanisms have been associated with serotonergic excess. This case study presents a 79-year-old African-American female, an assisted living resident, who presented to the emergency department with altered mental status, acute onset of \"chills,\" reduced appetite, urinary incontinence, and an elevated temperature of 103 degrees F (39.4 degrees C). Extensive initial diagnostic findings were negative for urinary tract infection, systemic infection, pneumonia, myocardial infarction, and stroke. Despite aggressive medical management, including intravenous hydration and broad-spectrum antibiotics, the patient continued to become more confused, agitated, and despondent over the subsequent 24 hours. The initial working diagnosis did not include serotonin syndrome, but once other studies did not reveal an etiology of the symptoms and the patient continued to be delirious, paroxetine was discontinued and all symptoms resolved within 48 hours of last dose. Voluntary reporting, postmarketing surveillance, and implementation of well-designed randomized clinical trials are all mechanisms to gather data on serotonin syndrome.

Transfer from the intestinal lumen to the mucosal cells at low As(V) concentration (0.1 mM) is rapid, while transfer from the mucosal cells to the body occurs more slowly. At stable As(V) concentrations greater than 1 mM, fractional mucosal cell accumulation of As(V) remains constant, while fractional transfer to the body declines. However, total mucosal accumulation of As(V) and that transferred to the body increase in a linear logarithmic fashion from 0.05 to 5 mm As(V). The results indicate that As(V) readily penetrates both the mucosal and serosal surfaces of the epithelial membrane. Furthermore, arsenate and phosphate do not appear to share a common transport pathway in the duodenum and no evidence was obtained for any interaction between the two at this level.

Although possible interactions can be predicted based on a drug's pharmacokinetic parameters, the clinical significance is often unknown. We describe two patients who experienced serious quetiapine adverse effects potentially mediated through an interaction with ritonavir-boosted atazanavir. The first patient was a 57-year-old man with HIV and bipolar disease who developed rapid and severe weight gain when quetiapine was added to a stable atazanavir-ritonavir-based antiretroviral regimen. After the patient discontinued both quetiapine and ritonavir, his weight returned to its baseline value. The second patient was a 32-year-old woman with HIV, anxiety disorder, and a history of intravenous drug abuse who developed increased sedation and mental confusion when an atazanavir-ritonavir-based antiretroviral regimen was added to her stable antianxiety drug regimen, which included quetiapine. Her symptoms resolved promptly after discontinuation of the quetiapine. Use of the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale indicated that the adverse effects experienced by the two patients were possibly related and probably related, respectively, to an interaction between quetiapine and atazanavir-ritonavir. Quetiapine is primarily metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, and ritonavir is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4. Thus, it is reasonable to theorize that quetiapine concentrations will increase when these drugs are used concurrently, which would be the likely cause of the toxicities in these two patients. To our knowledge, these are the first published reports of a clinically significant interaction between atazanavir-ritonavir and quetiapine. Clinicians should be aware of the potential for this interaction, and extreme caution should be used when prescribing quetiapine and other atypical antipsychotic agents in HIV-positive patients who are receiving antiretroviral therapy.",

Failure of LSS was thought to be due to the slow absorption of MPA causing late and variable times of maximum MPA concentration and variable predose concentrations. The aim of this study was to formally test the performance of LSS by developing and validating LSS for estimation of MPA AUC(0-12) after EC-MPS administration. Pharmacokinetic data from 109 renal transplant recipients collected during the maintenance period after transplantation were analysed retrospectively. LSS were developed separately for renal transplant patients who concurrently used cyclosporine (n = 79) and for patients not concurrently treated with cyclosporine (n = 30). Data were split into an index and a validation data set. For clinical feasibility reasons, a LSS could consist of a maximum of 3 sampling time points with the latest sample drawn 2 hours after drug administration. LSS with the latest sample drawn 3 hours after drug administration or even later were also tested. The validation of the developed LSS showed that MPA AUC(0-12) for patients concurrently treated with cyclosporine was best estimated by AUC(0-12) (mg x h x L(-1)) = 36.536 + 1.642 x C0.5 + 0.569 x C1.5 + 0.905 x C2 (r2 = 0.33, bias = -1.0 mg x h x L(-1), precision = 24 mg x h x L(-1)), whereas AUC(0-12) [mg x h x L(-1)] = 19.801 + 1.827 x C0.5 + 1.111 x C1 + 1.429 x C2 was the best AUC(0-12) estimator for patients not cotreated with cyclosporine (r2 = 0.31, bias = 0.4 mg x h x L(-1), precision = 14.5 mg x h x L(-1)). Both LSS showed poor precision and overestimation of AUC(0-12) values below the therapeutic window and underestimation of AUC(0-12) values above the therapeutic window of MPA. Using C3 as latest sampling time point improved the fit slightly, but not satisfactory, with r2 still <0.40 and precision still >14.0 mg x h x L(-1). Estimation of MPA AUC(0-12) with LSS for EC-MPS drawn within 2 or 3 hours postdose in renal transplant recipients in the maintenance period is likely to result in biased and imprecise results.",

He subsequently received high-dose chemotherapy containing cyclophosphamide (1.5 g/m(2)/day x 2 days), followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. He developed congestive heart failure 5 days after administration of cyclophosphamide.

Congestive heart failure progressed rapidly and he died the following day. Post-mortem examination of the heart revealed myocardial hemorrhage, yellowish brown pericardial effusion, and fibrinous pericarditis.

Although the association between SJS/TEN and the sulfonamide class of antibiotics is well established, the increasing prevalence of CA-MRSA has left practitioners with limited regimens to effectively treat skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) in the outpatient setting. In the case of SSTIs, alternative treatment of these infections should be considered, especially when the bacterial pathogen is unknown. Future investigations evaluating the efficacy of adjunctive antibiotics for purulent SSTIs and monitoring the incidence of SJS/TEN in the era of CA-MRSA are necessary to reduce unnecessary use of sulfonamide drugs. The potential development of SJS/TEN, a severe life-threatening illness, emphasizes the need for judicious use of TMP-Sx and close monitoring and follow-up for patients who were given TMP-Sx for SSTIs.",

The aims of the study are to evaluate the initial and steady-state pharmacokinetics of gatifloxacin when daily doses are given to patients with newly diagnosed drug-sensitive pulmonary tuberculosis as part of a combination regimen and to evaluate the gatifloxacin dose with respect to the probability of attaining a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic target. We describe the population pharmacokinetics of gatifloxacin from the first dose to a median of 28 days in 169 adults enrolled in the OFLOTUB trial in Benin, Guinea, Senegal, and South Africa. The probability of achieving a ratio of \u2265125 for the area under the concentration time curve to infinity (AUC0-\u221e) for the free fraction of gatifloxacin over the MIC (fAUC/MIC) was investigated using Monte Carlo simulations. The median AUC0-\u221e of 41.2 \u03bcg \u00b7 h/ml decreased on average by 14.3% (90% confidence interval [CI], -90.5% to +61.5%) following multiple 400-mg daily doses.

Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone was considered, therefore, duloxetine, and trichlormethiazide was discontinued and treated with fluid restriction, furosemide and sodium chloride administered orally. Disorientation and nausea were improved after correction of hyponatremia. Health care practitioners should be aware of the possibility of duloxetine-induced hyponatremia, particularly in patients treated with thiazide diuretics.",

All three patients experienced remission of their disease at the time of the occurrence of marrow aplasia. Reviewing data on these patients and recent literature indicate that fatal marrow aplasia seems to occur more frequently in sero-negative women who respond well to therapy with gold salts. Frequent blood monitoring in search for any pronounced or sustained drop in red, white or platelet count, even within normal range could serve as a warning sign for myelotoxicity. Despite intensive supportive measures and specific therapeutic attempts, all three patients eventually died of septic shock.",

He quit smoking after 1 week of therapy and remained smoke free for the next 17 days. During that time, he had also been taking amphetamine-dextroamphetamine (Adderall) on work days for his ADHD. Because his supply of amphetamine-dextroamphetamine was diminishing, he took only half (30 mg every morning) of his prescribed dosage from days 4-12 of varenicline therapy. He further reduced his dosage to 15 mg every morning on days 13 and 14 of varenicline therapy, and his supply of amphetamine-dextroamphetamine was depleted on day 15. On day 23 of varenicline therapy, he received and filled a new prescription for amphetamine-dextroamphetamine and resumed his prescribed dosage (30 mg twice/day). He began smoking again within 48 hours. Rechallenge with varenicline while the patient continued to receive amphetamine-dextroamphetamine yielded similar results. Data suggest that addition of amphetamine to varenicline may negate the partial agonism of varenicline, resulting in elimination of the smoking-cessation aid's benefits. Other potential mechanisms for the drug interaction may also exist. Thus, varenicline may not aid smoking cessation in patients undergoing treatment with amphetamine and amphetamine-like drugs.",

The depth and durability of responses attained with these agents in the first-line setting has raised the possibility that they may be considered primary therapy. The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group E1A05 clinical trial addresses the potential role of bortezomib and dexamethasone (VD) or VD plus lenalidomide (VRD) as primary first-line therapy. This clinical trial enrolls patients who have completed a dexamethasone-based induction (excluding patients using bortezomib). Assuming that most patients entering this clinical trial have been previously treated with thalidomide or lenalidomide, the trial will test whether switching to a proteasome inhibitor (VD arm) versus adding a proteasome inhibitor (VRD) results in superior longterm disease control. Patients entering this clinical trial will have deferred stem cell transplantation until the time of relapse. The primary endpoint of the trial is progression-free survival. By using an alkylator-free consolidation and reserving stem cell transplantation until the time of relapse, we hope that these treatment strategies will further prolong the survival of patients with myeloma.",
